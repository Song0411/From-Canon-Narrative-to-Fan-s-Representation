post,"Sang Woo is disgustingly calculative. Why does everyone keep defending him

The rule is ""If you win 6 games, you'll win"", not ""if you are the last one to survive, you'll win"". 

Sang Woo CHOSE to not help his mates in the honeycomb round because he knows that more dead people means more money. That action does not come from survival instinct, it's greed. People trying to argue that his actions are relatable and understandable are sick. If you actively refuse to help others from dying just to get more money, you're a bad person, there is no arguments here.",sang woo is disgustingly calculative why does everyone keep defending him the rule is if you win 6 games youll win not if you are the last one to survive youll win sang woo chose to not help his mates in the honeycomb round because he knows that more dead people means more money that action does not come from survival instinct its greed people trying to argue that his actions are relatable and understandable are sick if you actively refuse to help others from dying just to get more money youre a bad person there is no arguments here
post,"Sang Woo is not evil at all in the game.

At our first time watching Squid Game, most of us would conclude that Sang Woo is a cold hearted bastards who only cares about money. But from my view, if we look closer into his actions and personality. We can hardly say that Sang Woo is evil.

Red Light Green Light:

In this game, Sang Woo came on just like a hero to Gi Hun. When Gi Hun is in shock of the game and being unable to move. Sang Woo saved Gi Hun's life by telling him to hide behind other players to avoid the sniper. None of this proves that Sang Woo is evil. And after the game end when every players  are begging the guards to stop the game and they are being threatened at gun points. Sang Woo mentioned the third clause of the contract which can terminate the game. And we can see that 14 people didn't return to the game. Saying that Sang Woo indirectly saved 14 people.

&#x200B;

Outside the game:  
Here none of his evilness is shown too, he helped Ali when he himself as in terrible debt. He bought Ali the ramen, or noodles and even help him to catch a bus fare, showing that Sang Woo is a friendly person. Sang Woo has high pride, he is so ashamed that he couldn't face his mother nor the police and even tried to kill himself

&#x200B;

Sugar Honeycomb

At the first of the game, Sang Woo didn't tell other's the shape they should all choose which I find strange and I won't even argue cause I find this to be the most out of character thing Sang Woo ever did considered how he always try to help. But a point to add is that he himself do not know what the game is. All he knows from Sae Byeok is that they were melting sugar. What if it was a treat for the guards, what if the game is a fight to the dead games with the umbrella having a gun and the triangle having a bow. We can find that it's hard to blame Sang Woo for not telling his team the shape cause he was trying to spread the risk.

Marbles:

Even though I love Ali and even if i was angry that Sang Woo betrayed him, it's hard to blame Sang Woo. It's a life and death game and Sang Woo has a mother to take care of. How many of us would give up our life to a kind stranger like Ali, all of us will try to save ourself cause that's self preserving. Sang Woo did tricked Ali but he wasnt heartless when he did it. When he was about to walk out of the game stage. We can see the guilt in Sang Woo eye and he was sad, even if tears didn't come out of his eye. Of course if Sang Woo has a way to save both Ali and him, he would've done it but in the marble game, there could only be one winner. Even Gi Hun had to trick the old man to save himself

&#x200B;

Glass Stepping Stone.

Yea he did pushed the glassmaker but he was highly justified. From Sang Woo own words, the glassmaker could've saved everyone but he just looked at them as each died. There was 1 tile left with 20 seconds and if Sang Woo wouldn't do something, they would all die. Gi Hun, Sae Byeok, he took matters in his own hand and pushed the glassmaker but he can see the guilt in his eye after he pushed the glassmaker, if he didn't have shame then he would've jumped right away but no, he had to take some seconds to calm his nerves down. And he saved Gi Hun as he was 1 second away from dying from the glasses. I even have a theory that the glassmaker knew what the correct tile is but he was trying to buy the time until it is almost out to get rid of the rest of the 3 people or at least just 2 of Sae Byeok and Gi Hun, given that he didn't tell that he can tell the difference between the glasses for the players who went first, what will stop him from doing the same to take out some more competitors?

&#x200B;

Killing Sae Byeok

Yea, he did killed Sae Byeok but Gi Hun was going to kill him. Sae Byeok was dying and she was running out of blood. I doubt the workers will treat her as seen from how they just calmly take player 271 body away after 101 killed him after the honeycomb game. Sang Woo helped to take her out of her misery, and even after he killed her. He was in shocked as we can see from his eye. Just like when he killed Ali and the glassmaker. He helped to take her out of her misery and suffering

&#x200B;

Squid game

Sang Woo took the honorable way out, when Gi Hun defeated him and was trying to save him, Sang Woo can finally see Gi Hun kindness and he sacrificed himself so Gi Hun could've get the money knowing he will help Sang Woo's mother and he did. Maybe Gi Hun even gave money to Ali's family offscreen.

&#x200B;

Conclusion

From all of these facts we have seen above. Sang Woo isn't evil in anyway, he did all he could to save himself and he does so with guilt, shame and sadness unlike Deok Su the gangster. We can conclude that Sang Woo is someone who got put in bad situations and had to save himself but he feel shame and isn't sadistic in anyway or have pleasure in his actions.",sang woo is not evil at all in the game at our first time watching squid game most of us would conclude that sang woo is a cold hearted bastards who only cares about money but from my view if we look closer into his actions and personality we can hardly say that sang woo is evil red light green light in this game sang woo came on just like a hero to gi hun when gi hun is in shock of the game and being unable to move sang woo saved gi huns life by telling him to hide behind other players to avoid the sniper none of this proves that sang woo is evil and after the game end when every players are begging the guards to stop the game and they are being threatened at gun points sang woo mentioned the third clause of the contract which can terminate the game and we can see that 14 people didnt return to the game saying that sang woo indirectly saved 14 people x200b outside the game here none of his evilness is shown too he helped ali when he himself as in terrible debt he bought ali the ramen or noodles and even help him to catch a bus fare showing that sang woo is a friendly person sang woo has high pride he is so ashamed that he couldnt face his mother nor the police and even tried to kill himself x200b sugar honeycomb at the first of the game sang woo didnt tell others the shape they should all choose which i find strange and i wont even argue cause i find this to be the most out of character thing sang woo ever did considered how he always try to help but a point to add is that he himself do not know what the game is all he knows from sae byeok is that they were melting sugar what if it was a treat for the guards what if the game is a fight to the dead games with the umbrella having a gun and the triangle having a bow we can find that its hard to blame sang woo for not telling his team the shape cause he was trying to spread the risk marbles even though i love ali and even if i was angry that sang woo betrayed him its hard to blame sang woo its a life and death game and sang woo has a mother to take care of how many of us would give up our life to a kind stranger like ali all of us will try to save ourself cause thats self preserving sang woo did tricked ali but he wasnt heartless when he did it when he was about to walk out of the game stage we can see the guilt in sang woo eye and he was sad even if tears didnt come out of his eye of course if sang woo has a way to save both ali and him he wouldve done it but in the marble game there could only be one winner even gi hun had to trick the old man to save himself x200b glass stepping stone yea he did pushed the glassmaker but he was highly justified from sang woo own words the glassmaker couldve saved everyone but he just looked at them as each died there was 1 tile left with 20 seconds and if sang woo wouldnt do something they would all die gi hun sae byeok he took matters in his own hand and pushed the glassmaker but he can see the guilt in his eye after he pushed the glassmaker if he didnt have shame then he wouldve jumped right away but no he had to take some seconds to calm his nerves down and he saved gi hun as he was 1 second away from dying from the glasses i even have a theory that the glassmaker knew what the correct tile is but he was trying to buy the time until it is almost out to get rid of the rest of the 3 people or at least just 2 of sae byeok and gi hun given that he didnt tell that he can tell the difference between the glasses for the players who went first what will stop him from doing the same to take out some more competitors x200b killing sae byeok yea he did killed sae byeok but gi hun was going to kill him sae byeok was dying and she was running out of blood i doubt the workers will treat her as seen from how they just calmly take player 271 body away after 101 killed him after the honeycomb game sang woo helped to take her out of her misery and even after he killed her he was in shocked as we can see from his eye just like when he killed ali and the glassmaker he helped to take her out of her misery and suffering x200b squid game sang woo took the honorable way out when gi hun defeated him and was trying to save him sang woo can finally see gi hun kindness and he sacrificed himself so gi hun couldve get the money knowing he will help sang woos mother and he did maybe gi hun even gave money to alis family offscreen x200b conclusion from all of these facts we have seen above sang woo isnt evil in anyway he did all he could to save himself and he does so with guilt shame and sadness unlike deok su the gangster we can conclude that sang woo is someone who got put in bad situations and had to save himself but he feel shame and isnt sadistic in anyway or have pleasure in his actions

post,"I liked Sang-woo

This is late, but it's been laying around my brain, so here it goes. IMO, Sang-woo is the most well-written and my favourite character in Squid Game despite what he did, because I think his storyline can be relatable to most of us.

I interpreted his storyline more as how there are times when morality and ambition are mutually exclusive; like how you can maintain your integrity and fall backwards, or how you can rise to the top and lose your sense of identity. His scenes where he killed Ali and had the knife fight with Gi-hun didn't make me hate him because there were clear displays of guilt. I think it's something relatable to teenagers, working adults and more because there are times when we can screw over others to get what we want. 

I sort of wish he had been the main character instead of Gi-hun too. I think from a strategic standpoint, Sang-woo would have made a better MC only if Squid Game had shifted its original message slightly. From a personal standpoint, Sang-woo would've been better than Gi-hun because, well, my main reason is simply that I don't like Gi-hun: I don't like that he stole money from his mother, advocated against his daughter going to America, and hit the stepfather like he was any better. He was entitled, impulsive, and didn't even get on the plane. 

I know some people will absolutely downvote my post to death because I favour Sang-woo over Gi-hun, but I don't care , I'm willing to hear other opinions though. Granted, what he did was unjustifiable and horrible, but I don't believe that it defines him as a whole. We're more than our mistakes.

EDIT: There's something I'd like to add. I actually think Gi-hun is important to the plot, and I think it would've made him a lot more likable if he were a side character rather than the MC. Gi-hun and Sang-woo are both similar with their intentions, even though they're drastically different with personalities, and that's why I think it was important to include Gi-hun in - he was an idealist who believed being kind and generous would let grant him the win (the person we all wish we could be), whereas Sang-woo was the realist who always had his mind set on the goal (the one we all would be). To be honest, it makes me appreciate Gi-hun and opens my teenage brain a lot more.",i liked sangwoo this is late but its been laying around my brain so here it goes imo sangwoo is the most wellwritten and my favourite character in squid game despite what he did because i think his storyline can be relatable to most of us i interpreted his storyline more as how there are times when morality and ambition are mutually exclusive like how you can maintain your integrity and fall backwards or how you can rise to the top and lose your sense of identity his scenes where he killed ali and had the knife fight with gihun didnt make me hate him because there were clear displays of guilt i think its something relatable to teenagers working adults and more because there are times when we can screw over others to get what we want i sort of wish he had been the main character instead of gihun too i think from a strategic standpoint sangwoo would have made a better mc only if squid game had shifted its original message slightly from a personal standpoint sangwoo wouldve been better than gihun because well my main reason is simply that i dont like gihun i dont like that he stole money from his mother advocated against his daughter going to america and hit the stepfather like he was any better he was entitled impulsive and didnt even get on the plane i know some people will absolutely downvote my post to death because i favour sangwoo over gihun but i dont care im willing to hear other opinions though granted what he did was unjustifiable and horrible but i dont believe that it defines him as a whole were more than our mistakes edit theres something id like to add i actually think gihun is important to the plot and i think it wouldve made him a lot more likable if he were a side character rather than the mc gihun and sangwoo are both similar with their intentions even though theyre drastically different with personalities and thats why i think it was important to include gihun in he was an idealist who believed being kind and generous would let grant him the win the person we all wish we could be whereas sangwoo was the realist who always had his mind set on the goal the one we all would be to be honest it makes me appreciate gihun and opens my teenage brain a lot more
post,"The strength of Sang-Woo’s moral character throughout the show is indicated from the first episode[ mega spoilers]

Preface: The purpose of this post is not to negatively criticize Sang-woo’s choices throughout the games, since survival is an incredibly powerful human instinct that drives people to do all kinds of insanely fucked up shit to stay alive. I haven’t seen the last episode, so if I see anymore examples of Sang-woo’s moral character in ep9, I’ll add them to the post. I do know the ending though, so don’t worry about spoiling it for me in the comments 

Edit 1: Just watched ep9! Didn’t really see anything else to add on Sang-woo’s character based on the episode that I didn’t already address in the original post. 

Thinking back on episode 1, in the scene where Gi-hun mentions Sang-woo when he buys fish from Sang-woo’s mother made me realize that Sang-woo always had a dubious moral character that influenced his selfish choices throughout his life and the game. 

When Gi-hun explains how he’s the reason Sang-woo got into SNU and Sang-woo never so much as bought him a drink, at first it seems like Gi-hun is being petty since Sang-woo was probably talented enough to get into SNU on his own and could likely have found different ways to get to school given how smart and resourceful he proves himself to be. 

But as the game progresses, Sang-woo continuously shows he never had any issues in his pre-games life with gleaning success off the backs of other people’s work/generosity and tossing them aside when he no longer considers them useful. To me, one of the most interesting things is that while Sang-woo is initially presented as a down on his luck dude who is naturally good-hearted (since he helped Gi-hun in the first game, gave Ali money for the bus, and didn’t want his mom’s property to be seized) and just made a bad life choice, he was actually brutally cutthroat the entire time and was only nice when it was convenient for him. Unfortunately for his opponents in the games, this means that even if he feels badly about screwing them over, he’ll still do it, because that’s what he’s always done. 

Examples, in chronological order:

 1. Using Gi-hun for rides to school, then never staying in touch with him after he (supposedly) found academic, professional, and financial success. I do think Gi-hun was being petty here, but the fact that Sang-woo never kept in touch illustrates his disregard for people in his life that have helped him succeed, even in small ways.  

2. Defrauding investors of money (that they may have worked very hard to accumulate) to bet on futures, losing everything, and catapulting himself into crippling debt

3. Using his mother’s business as collateral without her knowledge, and lying to her about his financial situation. Even wanting to win the money to prevent his mother’s financial ruin could be seen as selfish in the sense that he might not have wanted to ruin his pristine reputation as his neighborhood’s golden child. 

4. Hiding behind people in front of him during Red Light, Green Light (thereby taking advantage of their groundwork and sacrificing them to get ahead). Even telling Gi-hun about this trick may have been a ploy to help Gi-hun to get ahead so Sang-woo could hide behind him as well. 

5. Taking info from Sae-byeok about the honeycomb game after she did the work of sneaking around and risking her life to get information, not telling anyone else about it, then wanting to toss her aside for the next game because she is a woman (he didn’t actually toss her aside but he 100% would have if it had been possible).

6. Accusing Ali of cheating at marbles when he won fair and square, then lying to Ali and stealing his marbles. In this example, Ali did the work of winning almost every single marble, then Sang-woo stole from him, just like he stole from his investors. This is also Sang-woo’s point of no return since he cheated the only player he actually respected out of his rightful victory and caused his death. Sang-woo could reasonably justify that the players who had died up to this point weren’t dead because he tricked them into losing but because they weren’t skilled or lucky enough to win. His betrayal of Ali’s trust completely dismantles that justification from this point onward. 

7. Accepting the glass maker’s expertise to identify the tempered glass plates, then sacrificing him to find out which of the last pair of tiles was correct. I think this choice seems easier to forgive at first since they were nearly out of time and the glassmaker’s hesitation could have cost all 4 of them their lives. However, it’s also the first time that Sang-Woo gets his own hands dirty and directly murders someone, as opposed to all his other victims who were killed by the game staff (exception is the tug of war game, but he wasn’t alone in killing the opposing team). His only saving grace in this situation would have been if the man fell on the correct tile, but by this point, Sang-Woo was likely hoping the man would fall to his death so he’d have one less competitor. 

8. Using Sae-byeok’s injured state to his advantage to kill her before the final game. He was obviously (only obvious after you finish the episode though) not asleep after dinner and when he heard Gi-Hun making a commotion over Sae-byeok’s injury, he jumped at the chance to finish her off when she was less of a threat (this one is kind of a reach, but he did take advantage of the “work” done by the Frontman, or whoever designed the game, who rigged the bridge to explode and blow glass shards at everyone, resulting in Sae-byeok getting stabbed in the stomach)

*Edit 2: Okay I lied, I do have something to add about Sang-woo’s final action in ep9. 

9. Sang-woo killing himself to ensure Gi-hun’s victory is somewhat redemptive, but only to the extent that he prevents his mother from losing everything as a result of his poor life choices. He decides that he himself is no longer useful and tosses himself aside, thus securing his final success at the cost of trampling on Gi-hun’s life and taking advantage of his empathetic nature in order to get what he wants while leaving Gi-hun emotionally shattered. Gi-hun would have been a mess regardless of the outcome, but at least getting both of them out alive would have made the blow slightly more bearable.*

The only times Sang-woo doesn’t shit on everyone around him is during tug of war and the dormitory brawl, but only because teamwork was essential to his survival. 

I thought his character development was so great, especially when considering how the show actually sets up exactly the kind of person he is before we even meet him. 

TLDR: From the first mention of him in episode one to his final act in episode nine, Sang-woo is nice to people when it’s of no consequence to him, and mostly lacks hesitation in throwing people under the bus if it means he’ll get ahead.

post,"Sang-Woo wasn't evil in the games IMO

SPOILER ALERT!



I'm making the post after seeing a lot of people hating on Sang-Woo for his actions throughout the show which I don't really understand. I specify how he wasn't evil in the games, because outside of the games he definitely wasn't the greatest person out there. I'm going to discuss the main scenes people hate him for:

Sugar Honeycombs:

For some reason, he doesn't tell the others to all go for the triangle shape despite him figuring out the game. This is the only circumstance where I'd understand him being considered evil, but I'd call it more stupid than evil. At that point in the games, he'd want to keep his friends alive for future games, but for some reason he tries to kill them off pretty early, which makes little sense to me. What if Gi-Hun or Ali were killed? Then Sang-Woo would probably end up on a weak team for Tug of War and end up dead, so yeah I'd call that decision a stupid one.

Ali's Betrayal:

Despite how much I loved Ali's character and wished he would have won the games, I think it's unfair to call Sang-Woo evil for this betrayal. In a game of life or death, morality becomes the last thought on most people's minds, so it would make 0 sense for Sang-Woo to just give up and let himself die even after hearing Ali's reasoning for joining the games, especially when Sang-Woo could use the money to help his mother. As much as I hate to say it, the betrayal was actually kinda smart on Sang-Woo's part, even if it was somewhat dickish considering Ali was about to win.But again, it's life or death and I bet 99% people would do the same thing. It's not evil, it's just human nature. 

Pushing the glass man to his death:

This one I really don't understand, even my parents thought Sang-Woo was a prick for pushing this guy. Considering how much time Gi-Hun had left when he reached the other side of the bridge, it seems pretty clear that the glass man had to die. It's possible that the glass man could have made it as well, but he would have likely died anyway because plot armour for Gi-Hun exists. To me, it was way too risky to not push him considering how short time was. Plus it was a 50% chance he could have landed on a tempered glass panel anyway so. I think Sang-Woo was justified in this action.

The murder or Sae-Byok:

Three people left, one of them was stabbed by a flying shard of glass at the end of game 5 (very unfair that she got an injury so severe despite winning the game). Anyways, she's slowly dying and Gi-Hun decides to try and get medical help for her, seemingly forgetting that he is playing a life or death game. Sang-Woo then decides to kill her, putting her out of her misery (I'm aware that he probably just did it to help him win). Do people not realise that Sang-Woo had to murder her? You can't play squid game with three people that's unfair. One person had to go and it may as well be the already dying girl. Sang-Woo was again, justified in killing her... but I do wish she didn't have such an unfair fate. As much as I like Gi-Hun, he forgets what he's playing and then gets mad at Sang-Woo for actually playing the games.

In conclusion, he might have been an ass outside of the games, but in the games he was for the most part logical and his decisions were mostly reasonable. He isn't the evil demon I've seen people portray him as, instead he is a smart player who is more practical than moral.

Edit:He was evil but I think his decisions were mostly justified, so I wouldn't class them as entirely evil.",sangwoo wasnt evil in the games imo spoiler alert im making the post after seeing a lot of people hating on sangwoo for his actions throughout the show which i dont really understand i specify how he wasnt evil in the games because outside of the games he definitely wasnt the greatest person out there im going to discuss the main scenes people hate him for sugar honeycombs for some reason he doesnt tell the others to all go for the triangle shape despite him figuring out the game this is the only circumstance where id understand him being considered evil but id call it more stupid than evil at that point in the games hed want to keep his friends alive for future games but for some reason he tries to kill them off pretty early which makes little sense to me what if gihun or ali were killed then sangwoo would probably end up on a weak team for tug of war and end up dead so yeah id call that decision a stupid one alis betrayal despite how much i loved alis character and wished he would have won the games i think its unfair to call sangwoo evil for this betrayal in a game of life or death morality becomes the last thought on most peoples minds so it would make 0 sense for sangwoo to just give up and let himself die even after hearing alis reasoning for joining the games especially when sangwoo could use the money to help his mother as much as i hate to say it the betrayal was actually kinda smart on sangwoos part even if it was somewhat dickish considering ali was about to winbut again its life or death and i bet 99 people would do the same thing its not evil its just human nature pushing the glass man to his death this one i really dont understand even my parents thought sangwoo was a prick for pushing this guy considering how much time gihun had left when he reached the other side of the bridge it seems pretty clear that the glass man had to die its possible that the glass man could have made it as well but he would have likely died anyway because plot armour for gihun exists to me it was way too risky to not push him considering how short time was plus it was a 50 chance he could have landed on a tempered glass panel anyway so i think sangwoo was justified in this action the murder or saebyok three people left one of them was stabbed by a flying shard of glass at the end of game 5 very unfair that she got an injury so severe despite winning the game anyways shes slowly dying and gihun decides to try and get medical help for her seemingly forgetting that he is playing a life or death game sangwoo then decides to kill her putting her out of her misery im aware that he probably just did it to help him win do people not realise that sangwoo had to murder her you cant play squid game with three people thats unfair one person had to go and it may as well be the already dying girl sangwoo was again justified in killing her but i do wish she didnt have such an unfair fate as much as i like gihun he forgets what hes playing and then gets mad at sangwoo for actually playing the games in conclusion he might have been an ass outside of the games but in the games he was for the most part logical and his decisions were mostly reasonable he isnt the evil demon ive seen people portray him as instead he is a smart player who is more practical than moral edithe was evil but i think his decisions were mostly justified so i wouldnt class them as entirely evil

I find it interesting how he developed his relationship with Ali in general - while I do think he saw value in him, Sang-woo was probably aware of how ostracized Ali must've been, being an immigrant and all, and knew he could capitalize (lol) on earning his trust.

Generally speaking, I tend to gravitate towards characters who have a strong instinct for self-preservation (but aren't complete sociopaths about it): Mi-nyeo, Sang-woo, the Frontman, and even minor characters like the glassmaker and doctor.

I love his ruthlessness and pragmatism, but absolutely *hate* his arrogance. That little speech he gives to Gi-hun at the start of episode 8 is fucking delusional. Without Sae-byeok's tip about the sugar-melting, Il-nam's initial tug-of-war strategy, and especially the glassmaker's expertise, he would not have survived as long as he did.

Game 2 - his licking strategy was copied and helped numerous people make it

Night time slaughter - he pushed Sae Bayeok out of the way and saved from her being stabbed in the back

Tug of war - he was the leader and called out when the other team slipped and backed Sang Woos life saving call

#001 - kindly covered up his bed wetting

His willingness to end the game to save Sang Woo also says something.

It's not like Sang Woo didn't rely on the help of others (intel from Sae Bayeok, kindness from Ali to even hear him out during marbles, glass guy's sacrifice).

The robot can decide how much movement is too much, and kill about the number they want based on that in real-time.  

They stopped the riot right when they wanted to, they were counting.  
  
Half die in tug of war.  
  
Have die in marbles.  

If there were more than 16 players, there would have been more than 16 steps in the glass bridge. All but a few would die.  
  
And if more are still alive for squid game, they can decide to run it as teams, or elimination, or whatever they want instead of 1v1.  
  
And we know from the way the games are introduced to the VIPs that they play different games at the facility, they could choose the game based on how many people they want to eliminate in any step.  
  
So while I think the rules allow for more than one winner, they game makers can force things to a large degree. If the last few players vote to leave, they don't get the money, it goes to the losers families (might be a bit of a plot hole that this doesn't happen the first time they vote), it's only split if they successfully get through all games, and the game makers can all but guarantee that doesn't happen.

comment,"I enjoyed his character a lot. Only thing I am wondering though. Even if he had the money, wouldn't he still be wanted by the police? Like it wasn't just debts he had to pay, he committed various crimes like I think he did something with fraud and tax evasion so his only out would be him fleeing the country but even then, I don't think he would be able to spend the money unless he took it all out and fled the country. Even then it looks suspicious if he goes on a flight. If he gets a private jet from say a criminal organization, what is to stop them from killing him for the money?   
   
Guess maybe he would had given most of it to his mother but also thinking too he wasn't really thinking about the solution just more thinking it was a way to one but not knowing what to do afterwards once he wins.

comment,"I think he took the best actions for winning the game. Ruthless and cold blooded but man did what he had to do.

Man deceived Ali because it would've been him dead if he didn't. 

Pushing the glassmaker off the platform was pretty straightforward.
 But being so calculating as he was, wouldn't the best strategy just to stay on the final platform until the last second? He probably could've straight up won the game there and then if he prevented the other 2 from finishing.

Killing 067, he was straight up suicidal due to the sheer hopelessness of the situation, he had to prevent them from majority voting to end the game and to stop the 2 from ganging up on him. 

I quite like his character, if he was a real person, you have to admire the tenacity and preservation to do whatever it takes to win.

comment,"> But only 1 person can win

No where does it say that. In fact the very beginning of the game showed that Squid Game is normally a team game, not a 1-on-1 game.  
The only 3 games where people ""had"" to die was Tug-of-war, Marbles\*, and Squid Game (where half the players were eliminated each time). Every other game\*\* could have everyone win if they all played well, which means you could go in with a big group of people in Squid Game and the winning team splits the money. This was made clear from the beginning (win six games and get the prize pool).

\*footnote 1: Marbles even allowed the teams of 2 to _both_ come out alive while still technically following the rules (come up with a game where each player gets the other player's 10 marbles (essentially a game-ified trade), it never said the winner had to end up with all 20 marbles).  
\*\*footnote 2: The glass bridge is unlikely for the first player to guess right. But after 18 players maximum (likely less), they would have the path figured out.",but only 1 person can win no where does it say that in fact the very beginning of the game showed that squid game is normally a team game not a 1on1 game the only 3 games where people had to die was tugofwar marbles and squid game where half the players were eliminated each time every other game could have everyone win if they all played well which means you could go in with a big group of people in squid game and the winning team splits the money this was made clear from the beginning win six games and get the prize pool footnote 1 marbles even allowed the teams of 2 to both come out alive while still technically following the rules come up with a game where each player gets the other players 10 marbles essentially a gameified trade it never said the winner had to end up with all 20 marbles footnote 2 the glass bridge is unlikely for the first player to guess right but after 18 players maximum likely less they would have the path figured out

comment,"I think there are other interpretations of the ending scene with Il-nam.  

The way I saw it was that he set the whole thing up to spark Gi-hun’s faith in humanity. The whole reason Il-nam brings Gi-hun there is because he’s concerned for him because he knows he’s a decent person. Pretty sure he planned to die at exactly midnight too.  The point was that Il-nam didn’t need to see the outcome, because the wager wasn’t the point.  It was for Gi-hun alone to experience.  

Additionally, Il-nam says “anybody” can help him, which I thought was blatantly clear to be a rigged game in favor of Gi-hun because it meant he himself could literally just walk down and help the guy.  He was supposed to realize this. 

Otherwise are we supposed to believe it was all just a coincidence that such a “game” just randomly happened to occur at the exact time Gi-hun had been invited for by brains behind it everything?

comment,"There is something to be said about dying with dignity, though. If he figured out the game so early, then he knew he only had a 1/456 chance of being the final survivor already. That's obviously not great odds. 

If any of them believed in an afterlife, this game they were in--literally cutthroat as it was--still has bearing on their conscience and their soul--if there is such a thing. Just because you have to kill for survival, doesn't make the moral dilemma any easier to justify or handle. 

This is exactly why he wanted to die in the final game. Once he realized what he's done to get to this point in the game and couldn't win, he knew he couldn't live with himself. The only choice was death. 

I find that tragic, but saying he was smart and calculated is pretty myopic, too. He allowed his humanity to be consumed by what ultimately was an *optional* game. Even in an optimal conclusion, he would still have to deal with the fact that he became a killer for the rest of his life for nothing more than money.",there is something to be said about dying with dignity though if he figured out the game so early then he knew he only had a 1456 chance of being the final survivor already thats obviously not great odds if any of them believed in an afterlife this game they were inliterally cutthroat as it wasstill has bearing on their conscience and their soulif there is such a thing just because you have to kill for survival doesnt make the moral dilemma any easier to justify or handle this is exactly why he wanted to die in the final game once he realized what hes done to get to this point in the game and couldnt win he knew he couldnt live with himself the only choice was death i find that tragic but saying he was smart and calculated is pretty myopic too he allowed his humanity to be consumed by what ultimately was an optional game even in an optimal conclusion he would still have to deal with the fact that he became a killer for the rest of his life for nothing more than money

comment,"I think Sang-woo's subjective placement in the morality spectrum is interesting, because there's a lot of nuance between people's opinions, and I think you can tell a lot from people by that. Those who hate him endlessly and disregard any humanity in him tend to hold on very strongly to their moral values. Those who glorify his actions and try justify them tend to have a competitive and practical mentality, sort of like every man for themselves.

I think if Sang-woo was the MC instead of Gi-hun, he wouldn't be hated as much because I assume we would see the process of him losing his humanity and letting guilt eat him up.

You can like someone who died more but they are still dead. Liking someone who won more is just illogical.

In the end he accepted his loss and is the only reason the main protagonist has 45 billion won in a bank account - and yet the confused audience is still rooting for the winner - but the winner was a completely awful person both before the games and after - he wallowed in self pity for a year rather than immediately fulfilling the girl's wish for them to each help the others child.",he had nothing to lose irl unless he could repay his debts he was going to prison or worse he played the games that way intelligent and ruthless i think it odd that he is painted as a bad character when it was really kill or be killed none of the characters were there because they were good people and no one won this game without causing other peoples deaths you can like someone who died more but they are still dead liking someone who won more is just illogical in the end he accepted his loss and is the only reason the main protagonist has 45 billion won in a bank account and yet the confused audience is still rooting for the winner but the winner was a completely awful person both before the games and after he wallowed in self pity for a year rather than immediately fulfilling the girls wish for them to each help the others child

comment,"Definitely one of the most complex characters. 

His actions were morally reprehensible but logical. He didn’t want to hurt anyone, and he didn’t enjoy it. You could see it breaking him. 

But it’s like that cheesy reality show line “I didn’t come here to make friends, I came here to win.”

He was the smartest (that we saw) in playing the game. 

If the games, in the broadest sense, represent capitalism, then it would’ve been more realistic for him to be the winner. He was willing to do anything to succeed, even if it meant throwing everyone (literally) to the ground. 

Also completely sympathetic to his decision to end his life rather than end the games. Even as someone who spent most of the show thinking “vote to end it, you fools!” By the time they were at the last game, it would just be a complete waste not to see it through. Gi hun really didn’t make much sense to me in that scene. Like yeah I get it, he can’t go through with having his childhood best friend murdered. But at that point the dude was mostly dead - was it even established that the guards will patch him up in a hospital if they end the games? And he’d be letting go of all the money that he use to honor his friends memories by taking care of their loved ones. Just stupid. But I can see how in the moment the emotions would be strong.

Maybe it’s cultural differences, or the fact that I really know nothing about how the financial industry works, but I was unclear exactly what sang woo had done to become so indebted, and how morally wrong it is. Obviously putting his moms house and shop up for collateral is pretty awful - but I was also confused by that, because his mom didn’t seem homeless and she was working know some kind of shop, and she didn’t seem to know that her son wasn’t this great successful businessman anymore.

It was a noble thing to do but it was still cowardly. It's difficult to blame him because we want to like him but given the chance he would have certainly never done anything good had he actually won or escaped. He had no true intention of facing the consequences of his actions. I do not believe he would have helped his mother if he succeeded.

comment,">he even almost warns Gi-Hun, but then decides against it, suggesting heknew he was doing the wrong thing but didn't want to risk it

I don't see how he would have risked anything by helping out his teammates at that point. His decision there seems to be motivated by ruthless desire to eliminate as many competitors as possible which overrules his loyalty to Gi-Hun and the others.

>Maybe he could have taken that risk on the last panel but why would hejust throw himself onto it? I don't think anyone who isn't at the frontwould be willing to take such a risk, so I'd personally say it'sjustified.

Nobody wants to take a risk like that but pushing (literally) someone else to do it is hard to justify. When he betrayed Ali at least it was obvious that not doing so would have meant his death. Here he just pushes a guy who through his glass expertise was integral in him even making it as far on the bridge as he did. A somewhat understandable but still ruthless and evil act

>But again considering the deal Sae-Byok tried to make with Gi-Hun Idoubt they would just give up all that money, she wanted him to win inorder to help both families so I doubt she would have just forfeitedeverything.

I don't think it matters what she actually would have done. Sang-Woo believed she would call off the games and kills her for it. Evil regardless of whether he had pegged her correctly or not.

So what if he learned that they would be playing Squid Game for the final showdown? The only way this could justify his decision is if he was afraid Gi-Hun and Sae-Byeok would be teaming up on him but we know this fear is not what motivated him to kill her because he gives his actual reasoning in the last episode",he even almost warns gihun but then decides against it suggesting heknew he was doing the wrong thing but didnt want to risk it i dont see how he would have risked anything by helping out his teammates at that point his decision there seems to be motivated by ruthless desire to eliminate as many competitors as possible which overrules his loyalty to gihun and the others maybe he could have taken that risk on the last panel but why would hejust throw himself onto it i dont think anyone who isnt at the frontwould be willing to take such a risk so id personally say itsjustified nobody wants to take a risk like that but pushing literally someone else to do it is hard to justify when he betrayed ali at least it was obvious that not doing so would have meant his death here he just pushes a guy who through his glass expertise was integral in him even making it as far on the bridge as he did a somewhat understandable but still ruthless and evil act but again considering the deal saebyok tried to make with gihun idoubt they would just give up all that money she wanted him to win inorder to help both families so i doubt she would have just forfeitedeverything i dont think it matters what she actually would have done sangwoo believed she would call off the games and kills her for it evil regardless of whether he had pegged her correctly or not so what if he learned that they would be playing squid game for the final showdown the only way this could justify his decision is if he was afraid gihun and saebyeok would be teaming up on him but we know this fear is not what motivated him to kill her because he gives his actual reasoning in the last episode

He wasn't a bad character. All he ever did was try to survive and win the games. Desperate to have the money and move on, but he had to kill the others to go through that path. He held the guilt, and tried to be strong. When he betrayed ali, I felt a sensation that he didn't want to do it, but had to. He had a chance to win, by tricking his so-called friend. His friend was really kind, but naive. So, he took advantage of him. It was heartbreaking, but understandable at the same time. And he murdered people to exist. They were all in the same situation, so they had to have strategies. To be honest, I would of wanted to survive aswell, even if it hurts with the guilt. He may seem evil and horrible, but he has a reason. To exist. And my final thought about him... is that he wasn't a bad or the best, he was neutral and natural to me.

comment,">Forcefully try to equate gi hun and sang woo does injustice to both characters

It's not forceful, it's a recurring theme throughout the show - Gi-hun believes that if he'd had the intellect of Sang-Woo he'd have succeeded in life, however they both make the same mistakes and end up in the same place. Sang-Woo is definitely more cut-throat (lol) in achieving his goal to protect his mother, but that applies equally to himself in the end. It's also worth remembering they both re-entered the game knowing that many other people would have to die in order for them to get the prize.

But if you needed more convincing about the character parallels, this is from the wiki:  


>The two main characters Gi-hun and Sang-Woo were based on Hwang's own personal experiences and represented ""two sides"" of himself; Gi-hun shared the same aspects of being raised by an economically-disadvantaged single mother, while Sang-Woo reflected on Hwang having attended Seoul National University with high expectations by his family and neighborhood.",forcefully try to equate gi hun and sang woo does injustice to both characters its not forceful its a recurring theme throughout the show gihun believes that if hed had the intellect of sangwoo hed have succeeded in life however they both make the same mistakes and end up in the same place sangwoo is definitely more cutthroat lol in achieving his goal to protect his mother but that applies equally to himself in the end its also worth remembering they both reentered the game knowing that many other people would have to die in order for them to get the prize but if you needed more convincing about the character parallels this is from the wiki the two main characters gihun and sangwoo were based on hwangs own personal experiences and represented two sides of himself gihun shared the same aspects of being raised by an economicallydisadvantaged single mother while sangwoo reflected on hwang having attended seoul national university with high expectations by his family and neighborhood

comment,"There isn't much that I can add that hasn't already been said. 

The thing I liked about him is (I feel) he portrays the most realistic character. In these circumstances, you live or you die. While it sucks that you end up forming connections with these people, it is literally you or the next person and most people, regardless of the cash prize, are going to try to survive. The cash is almost irrelevant in the game. The only motivation for the cash is to actually win instead of just letting yourself die in the game because your life already sucks. Yes, your life could turn out better if you win, but if you don't win, you die. 

Most people are going to try to survive, point blank. So Sang-Woo made a point to live. That is how most people would play. They wouldn't be as dirty as some of the other players, but if given the choice, they would do some  bad things to survive.",there isnt much that i can add that hasnt already been said the thing i liked about him is i feel he portrays the most realistic character in these circumstances you live or you die while it sucks that you end up forming connections with these people it is literally you or the next person and most people regardless of the cash prize are going to try to survive the cash is almost irrelevant in the game the only motivation for the cash is to actually win instead of just letting yourself die in the game because your life already sucks yes your life could turn out better if you win but if you dont win you die most people are going to try to survive point blank so sangwoo made a point to live that is how most people would play they wouldnt be as dirty as some of the other players but if given the choice they would do some bad things to survive

comment,"I'm gonna explain what futures trading is, for those of you who thought it was a synonim of fraud.
Sang Woo worked with a lot of money, got greedy and wanted to make a lot of more money. Since he knew how the stock market works, he decided to invest all that money into futures, which is basically a type of trading where you speculate on the price of an asset in the future.

For example: let's say you like cryptocurrencies, and you are 99% sure that in a month, the price of Bitcoin will go up by 30%. You decide to invest all the money you have, and even borrow some from banks and other people (because once price goes up, you'll be able to repay them with interests, and still have a lot of more money for yourself). The problem is that 2 weeks in, and suddenly half the countries around the world decide to ban all crypto, making the price go down as hell. You are now in debt as F and have to play 6 children games.",im gonna explain what futures trading is for those of you who thought it was a synonim of fraud sang woo worked with a lot of money got greedy and wanted to make a lot of more money since he knew how the stock market works he decided to invest all that money into futures which is basically a type of trading where you speculate on the price of an asset in the future for example lets say you like cryptocurrencies and you are 99 sure that in a month the price of bitcoin will go up by 30 you decide to invest all the money you have and even borrow some from banks and other people because once price goes up youll be able to repay them with interests and still have a lot of more money for yourself the problem is that 2 weeks in and suddenly half the countries around the world decide to ban all crypto making the price go down as hell you are now in debt as f and have to play 6 children games

comment,"I read it well. There have been many articles discussing Sang-woo's morality since the show, but his behavior and the reason for it are well explained by time, making it a little cleaner and easier to read.

He's a very calculating person. It would be the same intention that his character graduated from the Department of Business Administration among many departments at SNU and was assigned a job as a securities analyst who had to use his brain countless times. Also, he would have set his actions from start to finish and moved. The issue of ""Is there only one winner?"" will already be a fait accompli for him. Because he used to work in the middle of financial competition. 

At the end, he talks directly to Gi-hun. ""I don't know about you, but I'm not alive because of him. I'm alive because I worked my fxxking ass off to stay alive."" Gi-hun began to doubt him in the honeycomb game and confirmed him in the glass bridge game, but in fact, Sang-woo was consistently the same from the beginning.

I agree that his character development is excellent. Many people love him and many people hate him. It is certain that it is an impressive character in either way.

comment,"(Major spoilers!)

Maybe I'm a complete sociopath but Sang Woo was actually the character I feel like I related to the most. And here is why...

He is selfish in a game where, in order to win, you have to be selfish. But there is tenderness in him that I think they intentionally showed in the scene with him and Ali outside the game, where he charges his phone so Ali can use it and gives him bus fare. You can see in his eyes that he struggled during the marbles game, but that he set his feelings aside and did what he had to do for the sake of the game. Either he is an asshole but he is alive or hes a good guy that's dead. 

I personally don't think he enjoyed deceiving Ali, but he knew it was the only way. Theres a nuanced moment in the honeycomb game where it seems like he almost tells them all to pick easy shapes, but hesitates because of the voice in his head saying the only way he will win is to be selfish. 

As the series progresses the loudest voice in his head is the one saying ""do whatever you have to do to win"" and he loses himself to the greed. And that's why the ultimate ending of the final squid game is so poetic. Because he sees the opposite of himself in Gi Hun. It's almost over, Gi Hun is just one kill away from more money than he has every dreamed of, and  he still does the selfless thing in that moment and offers to quit the game and walk away with nothing. Its then that Sang Woo realizes the monster this game turned him into, and he wont let that happen because he cant live with himself anyway, or the guilt of realizing he went about the game the wrong way and it cost so many people their lives. 

I think all of it makes him very human and very relatable.

Nah it's okay man, like I said before, I'm kosher if with people judging him Evil^(TM) in some sense, SangWoo does bad shit before and during the game. And I don't generally disagree with your assessment of his options in the game itself (Marble, hopscotch, Sae-byoek's straits v.s. the aims of the game ) It's making sense of the external factors and environment that also motivate and influence the character's intents, which is painting a more complete picture of them and the situation.

If Sang-Woo had finished what he set out to do in Ep 2 and the invite to return comes when he couldn't answer anymore, we'd have a different story.  The guy still committed crime for sure, but he wasn't a murderer before the game.",but yeah maybe it is unfair for me to put him into a little box whenthere are lots of viewpoints maybe the grey area is more suitable nah its okay man like i said before im kosher if with people judging him eviltm in some sense sangwoo does bad shit before and during the game and i dont generally disagree with your assessment of his options in the game itself marble hopscotch saebyoeks straits vs the aims of the game its making sense of the external factors and environment that also motivate and influence the characters intents which is painting a more complete picture of them and the situation if sangwoo had finished what he set out to do in ep 2 and the invite to return comes when he couldnt answer anymore wed have a different story the guy still committed crime for sure but he wasnt a murderer before the game

One thing I chose to believe is that he really did fall asleep in episode 8, that he wasn’t faking to lure Gi-hun into an attack or something. He woke up when Gi-hun started making a commotion. This makes it all the more painful that Sae-byeok stopped Gi-hun, only for Sang-woo to use that distraction to take her out.",definitely agree with your points this is a great breakdown of his character and why he’s so compelling we view him as an ally at first too and grow suspicious of him with the honeycomb and then eventually we’re stung by his betrayals to ‘our team’ one thing i chose to believe is that he really did fall asleep in episode 8 that he wasn’t faking to lure gihun into an attack or something he woke up when gihun started making a commotion this makes it all the more painful that saebyeok stopped gihun only for sangwoo to use that distraction to take her out
comment,"> Sung- Woo killed that guy not because it was either he die or they all die, but because it **might** be that if the guy takes too long they could all die.

In every previous game if you didn’t meet the win condition, you were killed. Red Light Green Light and the cookie game were both timed and everyone who didn’t finish on time was killed. I’m not sure why you think there was a chance of survival after the timer ran out during the glass bridge game.

He waited until the last possible moment to push the guy. If he had waited any longer, then GI-Hun definitely wouldn’t have made it in time, and maybe Sae Byeok and Sang Woo himself as well.

comment,"I think the whole point was that the viewer suspects him from the start, but hopes that he'll be better than that.  That hope makes the betrayal that much more personal.  Almost every moment is calculated towards fueling Gi-Hun and the viewer's desire for revenge at the end.  Which then makes Gi-Hun's attempt to spare Sang Woo at the end that much more cathartic. 

Who's the worst element of society?  The gambler?  The thief?  The religious hypocrite? The murdering gangster?  Or perhaps it is the wall street fraudster whose actions can negatively effect everyone?   Or are they all just victims of the system?  How much of it was them, and how much was just circumstance? 

Which is why they stress so much at the end that nobody was forced to participate.  Sang Woo wanted to participate more than anyone, and that's what sets him apart as being truly despicable.

comment,"Ok I didn't think there was much room to misunderstand my comments,  but I will clarify. I am talking about the morality of Gi-hun and Sang-Woo, and you are talking about similarities in life events and background. Even though both Gi-hun and Sang-Woo wanted money (a similarity), it seems like Sang-Woo immediately decided he needs to actively try to kill off as many people as possible (him letting Gi-Hun pick the umbrella), even though no one explicitly said multiple people could not win and share the prize (a key difference - Sang-Woo very easily does very dark things even if there arealternatives). I think Gi-Hun would have at least tried to save as many team members as possible (like he did with Sa-byeok) if only money was at stake, and only kill people as a last resort if the alternative meant he would die. Gi-hun is no hero and I think some of the other characters were better people, but he is a hell of a lot better than Sang-Woo.",ok i didnt think there was much room to misunderstand my comments but i will clarify i am talking about the morality of gihun and sangwoo and you are talking about similarities in life events and background even though both gihun and sangwoo wanted money a similarity it seems like sangwoo immediately decided he needs to actively try to kill off as many people as possible him letting gihun pick the umbrella even though no one explicitly said multiple people could not win and share the prize a key difference sangwoo very easily does very dark things even if there arealternatives i think gihun would have at least tried to save as many team members as possible like he did with sabyeok if only money was at stake and only kill people as a last resort if the alternative meant he would die gihun is no hero and i think some of the other characters were better people but he is a hell of a lot better than sangwoo

comment,"no he wasnt investing in other peoples futures, he was investing in futures:

Futures are derivative financial contracts that obligate the parties to transact an asset at a predetermined future date and price. The buyer must purchase or the seller must sell the underlying asset at the set price, regardless of the current market price at the expiration date.

I am guessing he was also investing in call options and puts:

Call options are financial contracts that give the option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock, bond, commodity, or other asset or instrument at a specified price within a specific time period. The stock, bond, or commodity is called the underlying asset. A call buyer profits when the underlying asset increases in price.  
  
A call option may be contrasted with a put option, which gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at a specified price on or before expiration.

&#x200B;

This type of investing can be extreely lucrative but is also extremely risky - you can easily 2x - 10x your money on a single trade, but if you dont hit your price targets before the expiration date than your option becomes worthless - literally goes to $0.  so instead of investing in stocks where lets say a stock goes down 25% - you could literally lose all your money ""gambling"" (cause thats what it is alot of times) on call options, puts, and futures.

comment,"I think a big point of the Sang-woo Gi-hun dichotomy was to make viewers question what makes someone a bad person

Sang-woo and Gi-hun are similarly-aged men who did similarly crooked things: stealing money from their mothers for personal gain. But their approach to the game is different. Sang-woo is the cynical realist while Gi-hun is the hopeful idealist. Sang-woo literally does the shoving, yet while Gi-hun says it’s wrong, he still benefits. It’s essentially laid out in their argument after the 5th game. If Sang-woo hadn’t have pushed him, they’d both probably be dead.

So does that make Sang-woo a bad person? I think that’s one of the questions the director wants the audience to question. He’s in some gray area between Gi-hun, who rejects violence, and Deok-su, who enjoys it

comment,"Also, a point I haven’t seen made as often is that for the first two games, one can effectively argue that the players who died weren’t killed by the actions of their opponents but by their lack of skill/strength/luck. It can even be applied to game 3 (tug of war) because even though Gi-hun’s team lacked strength, they made up for it with skill and strategy. 

So even with Sang-woo withholding his knowledge about the honeycomb game, if someone was skilled enough to pick out the shape or smart enough to try a different way (heating the needle, licking the dalgona), knowledge of the game beforehand was not absolutely necessary to winning the game, and each player was ultimately responsible for their own victory or demise in the beginning (not counting the dormitory riot), not Sang-woo. Of course, that all comes crashing down with the last 3 games, where most of the players’ deaths came at the hands of someone else fucking them over.",also a point i haven’t seen made as often is that for the first two games one can effectively argue that the players who died weren’t killed by the actions of their opponents but by their lack of skillstrengthluck it can even be applied to game 3 tug of war because even though gihun’s team lacked strength they made up for it with skill and strategy so even with sangwoo withholding his knowledge about the honeycomb game if someone was skilled enough to pick out the shape or smart enough to try a different way heating the needle licking the dalgona knowledge of the game beforehand was not absolutely necessary to winning the game and each player was ultimately responsible for their own victory or demise in the beginning not counting the dormitory riot not sangwoo of course that all comes crashing down with the last 3 games where most of the players’ deaths came at the hands of someone else fucking them over

comment,"Not saying I disagree or agree with your other statement, but I think there is a difference between Gi Hun and Sang Woos cheating. Sang Woo comes up with the cheat and goes from 1 marble to 20. Gi Hun gets the offer/provoked to cheat and goes from 1 marble to 2 (he still need to win at least another 4 rounds). My guess is all people that would do what Sang Woo did would do same as Gi Hun in his situation, but not the other way around. Both are bad but still thinks there is a level of cheating, and the opponent in the both cases adds a bit too (someone your age with a kid vs a 80 yo with a braintumor). 

I used the word ""cheat"" but think you have to agree with Sang Woos logic even if you think he is a bad person.

comment,"I agree it was a mistake to make Gi-hun the only POV character. Sang woo and the pickpocket (name escapes me) should have had equal time, pre-games. It’s not just that the other characters were equally interesting. But it also gave away the end of the games. There was no question who was winning the entire time. Even Gi-hun’s gambit at the end where we were supposed to think Sang woo might agree to the withdrawal…not suspenseful since it guaranteed his life to be ruined in prison and Gi-hun to be maimed or killed by organ thieves.

comment,"Honestly I wonder how certain he and other characters were that only one winner could get out. The initial rules made it sound like anyone who wins all 6 games can live to split the prize. 

I'm generally sympathetic to Sang-Woo, but I'm really confused about his actions during the sugar game UNLESS he was pretty confident only one person could win it all.

I thought otherwise he would want to keep his team intact to at least bolster his own chances of winning. Maybe having his whole team go triangle would be too suspicious, but he could have saved Gi-Hun. Or maybe because Gi-Hun had spent the past 5 minutes being really nice to Il-Nam and blabbing about SNU again, and saying he chose the umbrella for silly reasons, Sang-Woo decided he was an idiot and a liability? 

At least if he is pretty sure only one person wins, we can say that maybe he didn't want to directly be responsible for their deaths later or something.

All his other actions like fooling Ali so he doesn't die himself, and pushing the glassmaker, make more sense.",honestly i wonder how certain he and other characters were that only one winner could get out the initial rules made it sound like anyone who wins all 6 games can live to split the prize im generally sympathetic to sangwoo but im really confused about his actions during the sugar game unless he was pretty confident only one person could win it all i thought otherwise he would want to keep his team intact to at least bolster his own chances of winning maybe having his whole team go triangle would be too suspicious but he could have saved gihun or maybe because gihun had spent the past 5 minutes being really nice to ilnam and blabbing about snu again and saying he chose the umbrella for silly reasons sangwoo decided he was an idiot and a liability at least if he is pretty sure only one person wins we can say that maybe he didnt want to directly be responsible for their deaths later or something all his other actions like fooling ali so he doesnt die himself and pushing the glassmaker make more sense
comment,"People who think real life participants would sacrifice themselves for someone they just knew recently(Ali) or a childhood friend who grew apart after high school/college(Gi-Hun) watched too much anime. 

There is no way regular people would not be selfish unless they were family or REALLY tight-knit friends. Even then, people would sub-consciously use a decision-matrix to figure out whether they have a better chance to win the games or not.

The fact that he completely gave up his moral compass when losing in marbles is exactly why he’s evil.

Almost anyone would probably act the same, but that’s probably because people are pretty inherently evil when it comes to their own survival.

comment,">The murder of Sae-Byok:  
Three people left, one of them was stabbed by a flying shard of glass at the end of game 5 (very unfair that she got an injury so severe despite winning the game). Anyways, she's slowly dying and Gi-Hun decides to try and get medical help for her, seemingly forgetting that he is playing a life or death game. Sang-Woo then decides to kill her, putting her out of her misery (I'm aware that he probably just did it to help him win). Do people not realise that Sang-Woo had to murder her? You can't play squid game with three people that's unfair. One person had to go and it may as well be the already dying girl. Sang-Woo was again, justified in killing her

comment,"For starters I’m not defending Sang Woo at all.

“If you win 6 games, you’ll win” not “if you are the last one to survive, you’ll win”

This is true in theory, but after enough time passes it should become clear to most players it isn’t in practice. By game 4 it probably became obvious to most of the players that there would be only one winner. That game was designed in a way where most people would have to kill their closest ally/friend to move on. From there the cruelty of the games should be abundantly apparent. After the first two games there is no way to win without more directly causing the death of others. Most people would notice that pattern, even if only subconsciously, and assume from there that the final game would likely leave only one survivor. 

Now all that said, none of this excuses Sang Woo’s actions. I’m on your side in this. Even if he suspected from as early as game 2 that only one could win, there was no reason to let gi hun and the old man walk into that kind of danger so early. Allies are advantageous early on, so it doesn’t even make much sense from a purely tactical point of view. He decided to let gi hun walk into it despite that. Likely out of annoyance of the constant SNU comments, a reminder of his failure and shame. His actions in games 5-6 make more sense in the context that he (rightly) assumed that there would only be 1 winner, but it doesn’t make his actions any less cruel.",for starters i’m not defending sang woo at all “if you win 6 games you’ll win” not “if you are the last one to survive you’ll win” this is true in theory but after enough time passes it should become clear to most players it isn’t in practice by game 4 it probably became obvious to most of the players that there would be only one winner that game was designed in a way where most people would have to kill their closest allyfriend to move on from there the cruelty of the games should be abundantly apparent after the first two games there is no way to win without more directly causing the death of others most people would notice that pattern even if only subconsciously and assume from there that the final game would likely leave only one survivor now all that said none of this excuses sang woo’s actions i’m on your side in this even if he suspected from as early as game 2 that only one could win there was no reason to let gi hun and the old man walk into that kind of danger so early allies are advantageous early on so it doesn’t even make much sense from a purely tactical point of view he decided to let gi hun walk into it despite that likely out of annoyance of the constant snu comments a reminder of his failure and shame his actions in games 56 make more sense in the context that he rightly assumed that there would only be 1 winner but it doesn’t make his actions any less cruel

Once, the initial offer. Second after the vote and third at the very end. I think its okay to be mad at both sang woo's characteristics and the old man. They are both selfish people in their own way.

It's a moot point because everyone could have lived at anytime had they not been greedy. All they had to do was vote to end the games. There was no point in which they were not allowed to do this, even in the middle of a game.

The games are designed for only 1 winner. If you need proof, you can see the scene where the detective discovers the list of the past winners.

comment,">For some reason, he doesn't tell the others to all go for the triangle shape despite him figuring out the game. This is the only circumstance where I'd understand him being considered evil, but I'd call it more stupid than evil.

It's a stupid decision for all the reasons you laid out but it's clearly an evil one as well. He deliberately misleads people who had put their trust in him putting them into mortal danger presumably because he recognizes that in the end they too are his competitors. Yeah he would actually be better off at that point making sure they survive until the later rounds but the fact that he fails to grasp this doesn't make what he did morally acceptable. 

Agreed on Ali's betrayal. 

Not sure about pushing the man off the glass bridge. Can't quite remember how that scene played out but was there no option to go past him? With so few seconds left on the clock Sang-Woo did need to act but it seems like he could have taken the risk of landing on the wrong panel himself rather than killing the poor guy 

>Do people not realise that Sang-Woo had to murder her? You can't play squid game with three people that's unfair.

He obviously didn't need to kill her and he didn't even know what game they would be playing at that point. His reasoning for murdering her - that he was afraid her and Gi-Hun would take a vote and call off the games - did make sense but obviously speaks volumes about his character.

comment,"I think he was still struggling with his morality. Koreans have a very insular view - once you're in, you're IN, and they'll fight to the last breath for you. Conversely, if you're even a little bit ""other,"" they have no problem pushing you onto a glass platform that has a 50% chance of shattering, so they can live. Maybe not that specific or extreme, but you get my point.  


While he grew up with Gi-Hun, doesn't mean they were best buds. If anything, knowing what a sad sack and unreliable person Gi-Hun was, he would have been more motivated to be quick to drop him. In his eyes, Gi-Hun didn't have much to offer as a value-add to the team. He also kept bringing in ""strays"" like the old man. Yet, as a human being, he felt like he couldn't just ignore Gi-Hun (the complicated social rituals of saving face and pretending to be nicer than you are). We see it clearest when he calls Gi-Hun right before he heads off to the umbrella line.

In fact, I would say that's probably why Gi-Hun never confronted him about his suspicions after the game. In his shoes I would have 100% called him out. ""Da f\*ck man, you couldn't warn me??"" Instead, it's like as soon as he realizes it, he also accepts it. Heck, he doesn't even seem to hold it against him.

comment,"I have SO many thoughts but I know there have been a lot of posts so I won’t clog the feed anymore, I’ll just leave it all here. 

I refuse to get on the Sang Woo hate train and here’s why:

He did what he had to do to survive. He didn’t kill for fun or outside of the games, like other players. He only did it out of pure necessity. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized the finality of death and how precious and fleeting life really is. I’m not sure I could be quite as ruthless as him, but I 100% understand his motivations and don’t think he’s a bad person. 

1. Red Light Green Light- he whispered to Gi-Hun about hiding behind someone else. He did care about him and wanted him to live. He wasn’t a sociopath. 
2. Honeycomb- he figured out the game and declines to tell or help anyone else. This is the most eh moment for me, because telling them wouldn’t have directly resulted in his death. But not telling them was an indirect way to eliminate competition. He didn’t directly cause anyone to die, but he didn’t help them survive either. I don’t necessarily like the choice and don’t think I would make the same one, but I get it. 
3. Tug-Of-War- he was the one who came up with the idea to run forward and knock the other team over, so he shouldn’t get any flack here. Some people didn’t like that he didn’t want women or the older man but if they’re going off pure strength, chances are he’s right. I’m a woman. I work out with a personal trainer and for my size, I’m very strong. But chances are if I’m up against a lot of huge dudes, I don’t know how helpful I would be. Biologically men are stronger, it’s just science. He needed the strong in order to survive. 
4. Marbles- Ah, sweet, trusting Ali. Pretty sure I would be him and die. But again, Sang Woo did what he had to do to survive. Was it upsetting? Of course, and he looked shaken by it, he didn’t feel good about it. But his need to survive outweighed his compassion and I cannot say that I blame him. Again. He was playing for his life, not just money.  He had to do what it took to survive. 
5. Stepping stones- Oof. This one was harsh. Pushing the glassmaker was ruthless. This was also the first time he killed someone with his own hands. However, they were rapidly running out of time and IIRC they had less than a minute on the clock, I wanna say even less than 30 seconds. Whoever was left standing on the glass would die as soon as time ran out. They quite literally did not have time for this guy to hesitate like that. He could have gotten all 4 of them killed. I would be feeling pretty desperate if it were me. I was super stressed just watching it. And to be fair… it did eliminate another death trap. 
6. Squid Game- there was a possibility for more than one person to win on a team. After everything he had done, he knew the last 2 remaining players were going to team up to take him out. Killing Sae-byeok was horrible and sad. But… she was the only vulnerable one of the two, she was dying, and he was outnumbered. Again, he had to give himself the greatest odds of survival. This was also the first time he had ever gone after anyone outside the games. In the riot he defended his group. And in the end, he did what I considered a selfless thing. Granted he was in really bad shape anyway, and he was suicidal previously and probably couldn’t live with himself after what he did, but killing himself insured that Gi-Hun lived and could use the money to help himself and others. He had the opportunity to walk away with his life and he didn’t. He gave it up for Gi-Hun, who he probably considered the better man. 

People have to remember this isn’t just prize money. It’s life or death. We get one life. Once it’s done, that’s it. Whether you believe in the afterlife or not isn’t relevant to the point that we all only get one chance here. We’re all out here just trying to make it. Just trying to survive. Do I agree with all of his choices? No. As I said, I’m more of an Ali. But in that situation I cannot fault him for doing what was necessary in those moments to be able to walk away with his life. Desperation makes us do things we didn’t know we were capable of, and I can’t blame him for feeling intense desperation to live. Don’t we all?",i have so many thoughts but i know there have been a lot of posts so i won’t clog the feed anymore i’ll just leave it all here i refuse to get on the sang woo hate train and here’s why he did what he had to do to survive he didn’t kill for fun or outside of the games like other players he only did it out of pure necessity as i’ve gotten older i’ve realized the finality of death and how precious and fleeting life really is i’m not sure i could be quite as ruthless as him but i 100 understand his motivations and don’t think he’s a bad person 1 red light green light he whispered to gihun about hiding behind someone else he did care about him and wanted him to live he wasn’t a sociopath 2 honeycomb he figured out the game and declines to tell or help anyone else this is the most eh moment for me because telling them wouldn’t have directly resulted in his death but not telling them was an indirect way to eliminate competition he didn’t directly cause anyone to die but he didn’t help them survive either i don’t necessarily like the choice and don’t think i would make the same one but i get it 3 tugofwar he was the one who came up with the idea to run forward and knock the other team over so he shouldn’t get any flack here some people didn’t like that he didn’t want women or the older man but if they’re going off pure strength chances are he’s right i’m a woman i work out with a personal trainer and for my size i’m very strong but chances are if i’m up against a lot of huge dudes i don’t know how helpful i would be biologically men are stronger it’s just science he needed the strong in order to survive 4 marbles ah sweet trusting ali pretty sure i would be him and die but again sang woo did what he had to do to survive was it upsetting of course and he looked shaken by it he didn’t feel good about it but his need to survive outweighed his compassion and i cannot say that i blame him again he was playing for his life not just money he had to do what it took to survive 5 stepping stones oof this one was harsh pushing the glassmaker was ruthless this was also the first time he killed someone with his own hands however they were rapidly running out of time and iirc they had less than a minute on the clock i wanna say even less than 30 seconds whoever was left standing on the glass would die as soon as time ran out they quite literally did not have time for this guy to hesitate like that he could have gotten all 4 of them killed i would be feeling pretty desperate if it were me i was super stressed just watching it and to be fair… it did eliminate another death trap 6 squid game there was a possibility for more than one person to win on a team after everything he had done he knew the last 2 remaining players were going to team up to take him out killing saebyeok was horrible and sad but… she was the only vulnerable one of the two she was dying and he was outnumbered again he had to give himself the greatest odds of survival this was also the first time he had ever gone after anyone outside the games in the riot he defended his group and in the end he did what i considered a selfless thing granted he was in really bad shape anyway and he was suicidal previously and probably couldn’t live with himself after what he did but killing himself insured that gihun lived and could use the money to help himself and others he had the opportunity to walk away with his life and he didn’t he gave it up for gihun who he probably considered the better man people have to remember this isn’t just prize money it’s life or death we get one life once it’s done that’s it whether you believe in the afterlife or not isn’t relevant to the point that we all only get one chance here we’re all out here just trying to make it just trying to survive do i agree with all of his choices no as i said i’m more of an ali but in that situation i cannot fault him for doing what was necessary in those moments to be able to walk away with his life desperation makes us do things we didn’t know we were capable of and i can’t blame him for feeling intense desperation to live don’t we all

comment,">There is a chance he could have made it but I don't think it would be worth the risk considering Gi-Hun barely made it in time.

Maybe waiting for the man to make his decision would have led to Sang-Woo's death but I'm not convinced pushing him was necessary to ensure his survival. Again he could have just gone past him I think. Obviously had he done so he would have taken the risk of picking the wrong tile himself but he might still have made it. Ruthlessly pushing the guy did ensure his survival but that kind of ruthless selfishness is most definitely evil, don't you think?

>but he also states that he put her out of her misery

he does but Gi-Hun calls him out on this and he immediately admits his real reason for ending her life ie that he was afraid her and Gi-Hun would vote to end the games. 

>she would have bled out well before the Squid game even started so the way I see it, he put her out of her misery regardless of intentions.

I think this relies on way too many assumptions. Sure maybe he just ended her suffering but maybe she would in fact have called off the games as Sang-Woo feared and maybe that would have allowed her to receive the medical attention she needed. In fact maybe the guards would have intervened at some point during the night and helped her out to allow her participation in the final game. Bit of a stretch but neither we as viewers nor Sang-Woo know that she was 100% destined to die at that point hence why I would not consider him giving her the final blow a mercy.

Besides I don't think most people think entirely in consequentialist terms like that. Sang-Woo's intentions in killing her are evil which makes him evil even if he did just end up sparing her some suffering through his actions",there is a chance he could have made it but i dont think it would be worth the risk considering gihun barely made it in time maybe waiting for the man to make his decision would have led to sangwoos death but im not convinced pushing him was necessary to ensure his survival again he could have just gone past him i think obviously had he done so he would have taken the risk of picking the wrong tile himself but he might still have made it ruthlessly pushing the guy did ensure his survival but that kind of ruthless selfishness is most definitely evil dont you think but he also states that he put her out of her misery he does but gihun calls him out on this and he immediately admits his real reason for ending her life ie that he was afraid her and gihun would vote to end the games she would have bled out well before the squid game even started so the way i see it he put her out of her misery regardless of intentions i think this relies on way too many assumptions sure maybe he just ended her suffering but maybe she would in fact have called off the games as sangwoo feared and maybe that would have allowed her to receive the medical attention she needed in fact maybe the guards would have intervened at some point during the night and helped her out to allow her participation in the final game bit of a stretch but neither we as viewers nor sangwoo know that she was 100 destined to die at that point hence why i would not consider him giving her the final blow a mercy besides i dont think most people think entirely in consequentialist terms like that sangwoos intentions in killing her are evil which makes him evil even if he did just end up sparing her some suffering through his actions

What's more is that Sang-Woo went on to murder two people when he didn't really have to. That's something Gi-Hun would never do. They're all fighting for their life and Gi-Hun has both his mother and daughter to care for, where Sang-Woo just had his mother.

comment,"True but in this scenario the person also has the CHOICE of not helping you at all to get out of said situation . It is also your choice to not choose the option laid out infront of you and just find an alternative. My whole point is that everybody always have a choice. It could be a bad or good choice but the choice is your for the taking . If you make a bad choice even under duress , you can't blame the person because at the end of the it was your wish to go with that choice . Now , if under duress , you do something that was FORCED on you to do , then at that moment it becomes null and invalid and the person that forced you to do the act can be held responsible.  


In these story , the individual was never forced to do anything.  A number of choices were laid out to him and he chooses or wishes to go through with the alternative. It could be argued either you know?",true but in this scenario the person also has the choice of not helping you at all to get out of said situation it is also your choice to not choose the option laid out infront of you and just find an alternative my whole point is that everybody always have a choice it could be a bad or good choice but the choice is your for the taking if you make a bad choice even under duress you cant blame the person because at the end of the it was your wish to go with that choice now if under duress you do something that was forced on you to do then at that moment it becomes null and invalid and the person that forced you to do the act can be held responsible in these story the individual was never forced to do anything a number of choices were laid out to him and he chooses or wishes to go through with the alternative it could be argued either you know
comment,">she's also suffering and in pain

I don’t think so, I have’t bled to death but I’ve passed out due to blood loss, wasn’t painful. You slowly stop being conscious.   
I would think that she wasn’t fully awake anymore but the cut in the neck would cause pain and scare her in the moment.

 Also sang woo doesnt seem like a person to do things for mercy lol",shes also suffering and in pain i don’t think so i have’t bled to death but i’ve passed out due to blood loss wasn’t painful you slowly stop being conscious i would think that she wasn’t fully awake anymore but the cut in the neck would cause pain and scare her in the moment also sang woo doesnt seem like a person to do things for mercy lol

comment,"To me Sang-woo represents the age old question: do the ends justify the means? The answer, clearly, is no. In the marble game, the end he achieved was the same as if he won the game fairly—he lives, Ali dies. However, the means are the kicker. Even if he cheated, or stole Ali’s marbles somehow, that wouldn’t be worse than what he did. That would only be an act of self-preservation. What Sang-woo did was lethal deception, taking advantage of a man’s good will and friendship. He didn’t just lie, he leveraged a man’s good character against him. There is a reason, in Catholic tradition, that treachery leads to the darkest level of hell. That is what Sang-woo represents. I wasn’t as upset about the bridge game, when he pushed the guy. It was a 50-50 on that one guy versus a 100% chance of the back three dying. Most of us would have done the same. As for his final murder…terrible decision given she was surely dying anyways, but still not as sickening as what he did to Ali.",to me sangwoo represents the age old question do the ends justify the means the answer clearly is no in the marble game the end he achieved was the same as if he won the game fairly—he lives ali dies however the means are the kicker even if he cheated or stole ali’s marbles somehow that wouldn’t be worse than what he did that would only be an act of selfpreservation what sangwoo did was lethal deception taking advantage of a man’s good will and friendship he didn’t just lie he leveraged a man’s good character against him there is a reason in catholic tradition that treachery leads to the darkest level of hell that is what sangwoo represents i wasn’t as upset about the bridge game when he pushed the guy it was a 5050 on that one guy versus a 100 chance of the back three dying most of us would have done the same as for his final murder…terrible decision given she was surely dying anyways but still not as sickening as what he did to ali

Also it's for real, they tortured a pastor in north Korea and made woman KICK HIM IN THE BALLS, UNTIL HE LOST his testicles. It's such a terrifying story...

He wouldn't admit god wasn't real and didn't swear his undeniable worship to Kim. He finally got a chance to go home but the damage was already done.

I can't imagine every day getting kicked their for hours and hours.

His name is on the escaped north Korea wiki

Poor guy only wanted to voice his opinion on God, and they did that to him :(

There's an entire article with this info btw,

Also, some people wrote that guards did number 2 in their rice bowls... Extremely inhumane treatment, locked babies and people in cages that were meant for extremely small animals. Malnurished. Sick.

Really can't believe they did number #2 in those people's bowls that they used to eat rice out of, and they had to use whatever water they had to drink which was tiny to wash it off..

comment,"I would say “heel turn” because that’s the closest I can think of what you’re describing lol. But I’m actually not sure if that label applies because Sang Woo started off with the least sympathetic backstory and we got a red flag early on with the Dalgona game that he was out for himself.

I think what makes him work so well is his consistency up to his own end, and Hae Soo’s performance. I wasn’t surprised that he switched the marbles but I could see people being shocked at the sheer audacity of it. He was played as very nuanced, like you could tell he cared about Ali and he was debating telling Gi Hun about the umbrella, but then you’d see him table his feelings for the money.",i would say “heel turn” because that’s the closest i can think of what you’re describing lol but i’m actually not sure if that label applies because sang woo started off with the least sympathetic backstory and we got a red flag early on with the dalgona game that he was out for himself i think what makes him work so well is his consistency up to his own end and hae soo’s performance i wasn’t surprised that he switched the marbles but i could see people being shocked at the sheer audacity of it he was played as very nuanced like you could tell he cared about ali and he was debating telling gi hun about the umbrella but then you’d see him table his feelings for the money

comment,"I always saw Sang-woo's death as as a ""relief"", in the sense that he wanted to die because he knew he couldn't bear to live with the guilt. I never got the sense that he did it so that he wouldn't have to deal with the shame and lack of dignity because his self-worth seemed to stem on how he thought of himself, rather than what others thought of him. He would've been a lot more altruistic, less blunt, if he did care about what others thought, I think. 

I think Sang-woo's intentions were, if not similar, the same as Gi-hun's. He wanted to get out of debt and save his mother, and he still decided to live and try win the games instead of committing suicide in that bathtub. I think the difference in their characters shows, which is why although I dislike Gi-hun, I think he's an important character - Sang-woo leads with a pragmatic and practical approach (not creating any attachment to anyone, not confiding in anyone about his plans), whereas Gi-hun uses harmony and kindness. Because of their similar intentions, IMO, I don't think Sang-woo was selfish. Just misunderstood. 

But again, it's your opinion and you're entitled to it. I can agree that he can seem selfish because actions do speak louder than words. Besides, all shows and movies are usually up to the audience's interpretation and symbolism. That's just how I saw Sang-woo and Gi-hun, basically two sides of the same coin.

comment,"One of the most realistic and logical character in the show. I fucking love him. Gi-hun and other characters on the other hand are so hypocritical and dumb. Throw your shitty moral compass out of the window when you were willing to spend the money built on the blood of the participant until the last minute of the game and signed the contract for the SECOND TIME. When Gi-hun was having his childish mental breakdown and shouting Sang-woo in the last game I was like ""wtf didn't u kill the old man and pulled a whole group of people down to their death in the tug of war game? how hypocritical can you be?"". Gi-hun was also so unrealistically slow that it was not until after the game that the guilt of using blood money finally came down on him and that really takes me out of it. I 100% would've done what Sang-Woo did. Fuck him for trying to play the game, which is basically survival of the fittest, optimally and being the most logical person out there I guess.

It's sad that Sang-Woo killed Ali but let's be realistic. For character like Ali, there can only be 2 ways you can go about it in death game like this. 1 - he died the way he did for his naivety as in the show. 2 - some kind of big twists came out and revealed that he wasn't as kind and naive as he looks.",one of the most realistic and logical character in the show i fucking love him gihun and other characters on the other hand are so hypocritical and dumb throw your shitty moral compass out of the window when you were willing to spend the money built on the blood of the participant until the last minute of the game and signed the contract for the second time when gihun was having his childish mental breakdown and shouting sangwoo in the last game i was like wtf didnt u kill the old man and pulled a whole group of people down to their death in the tug of war game how hypocritical can you be gihun was also so unrealistically slow that it was not until after the game that the guilt of using blood money finally came down on him and that really takes me out of it i 100 wouldve done what sangwoo did fuck him for trying to play the game which is basically survival of the fittest optimally and being the most logical person out there i guess its sad that sangwoo killed ali but lets be realistic for character like ali there can only be 2 ways you can go about it in death game like this 1 he died the way he did for his naivety as in the show 2 some kind of big twists came out and revealed that he wasnt as kind and naive as he looks

Just like Gihun had to make the choice to lie to the old man to win marbles (of course, he found out later that he was tricked but in the moment he felt BAD but did it anyway).

He helped in the beginning cause he could and there were hundreds of players left…

But the more and more it got REAL that he could die? He did what he could to stay alive.

Especially with him being suicidal over all the mess he made back in his life? I certainly feel he was realistic.

And he felt remorse to me when Ali died.

That’d tear me up but if I were in a 1:1 survival game I have NO CLUE what I would’ve done to stay alive.

comment,"I think he also quickly picked Ali as his partner for marbles because he had a very good idea that it was going to be a 1 vs 1 type game. That’s why Gi Hun was surprised because he figured Sang-Woo would naturally be his partner. It was the optimism/denial that everyone else had that kept them from seeing what was happening up to that point. While everyone was looking for a teammate that was strong, intelligent, etc., Sang-Woo had figured out the odds of there being a twist. Also, he knew that out of everyone Ali would be the easiest for him to manipulate if need be so he was a good partner in either scenario. However, I think a big factor in that action was also that he couldn’t bear the idea of having to be responsible for his friend’s death at that juncture. 

The honeycomb game was the indicator, (along with being called a genius over and over), that Sang-Woo was particularly good at assessing the game/scenario faster than anyone else. He’s a villain but also a dead man walking. When you’re at that point where even if you win you’re still in a huge amount of debt, you really have nothing to lose. The guy is merely trying to save his mom’s business, house, and pride. Only one person was walking out of that place alive. All it would take is another mini game or change by Il-Nam or the Frontman to make it happen if there were more people that were saved along the way. The idea I keep seeing floating around with a scenario where more than one person was walking out of there with the money and alive must not have listened to the VIP’s and how they each bet on ONE person to win.

comment,"This makes sense to me too. He was looking at the final glass panels before the lights went off, and then when he got the marble he threw it at the far (correct) panel. Why would he choose to throw it at the far one and not the closer one in front of him? 

I guess to me I would be more concerned about somehow missing the panel with the marble since it’s farther, or less likely to hear the sound it makes correctly from farther away and choose to throw it at the closer one since that would seem more practical. At the same time, maybe he didn’t get a good look at the far panel and that’s why he opted for it to do the sound test.

Either way, I think when he heard that marble hit the glass he knew it was the right one but decided to stall.",this makes sense to me too he was looking at the final glass panels before the lights went off and then when he got the marble he threw it at the far correct panel why would he choose to throw it at the far one and not the closer one in front of him i guess to me i would be more concerned about somehow missing the panel with the marble since it’s farther or less likely to hear the sound it makes correctly from farther away and choose to throw it at the closer one since that would seem more practical at the same time maybe he didn’t get a good look at the far panel and that’s why he opted for it to do the sound test either way i think when he heard that marble hit the glass he knew it was the right one but decided to stall

I can imagine Sang-Woo’s conscience had perhaps slowly having been broken down in the corporate world. Gi-Hun had a different experience, he was perhaps more of a person guilty and scummy due to passivity, in his life. Whereas others like Sang-Woo were guilty in a more active way, if that makes sense. I think it’s easier for us to be like Gi-Hun, someone like Sang-Woo is so overtly ”bad” that they are condemned right away. And we think it’s good to be more a Gi-Hun than a Sang-Woo, but then we fall into that trap of arrogance of thinking you’re better than others because of X, Y, or Z.",precisely thats a really cool thing to delve into how people are just people and how we all have our own stories and justifications for being what we are i can imagine sangwoo’s conscience had perhaps slowly having been broken down in the corporate world gihun had a different experience he was perhaps more of a person guilty and scummy due to passivity in his life whereas others like sangwoo were guilty in a more active way if that makes sense i think it’s easier for us to be like gihun someone like sangwoo is so overtly ”bad” that they are condemned right away and we think it’s good to be more a gihun than a sangwoo but then we fall into that trap of arrogance of thinking you’re better than others because of x y or z

comment,"~~""Futures"" is important. Basically, unlike other stock options, what you do with futures is you sell stocks you don't own in the hope that the money you make now will be more than the money you have to pay back later. For example:~~

1. ~~I think that Company ABC is about to absolutely tank in value.~~
2. ~~I want to sell 10,000 stocks of Company ABC at $10 each. However, I don't actually have 10,000 stocks! So I take out what is effectively a ""loan"" of stocks, make my $100,000, and then wait for the loan to be resolved.~~
3. ~~If Company A does tank and the stock drops to $1, I can then choose to pay back that stock loan at that point to the value of $10,000, leaving me with $90,000 for my troubles.~~

~~HOWEVER -- and this is what happened to Sang-woo -- the risk with futures is that there is no theoretical limit to how much you have to pay back. For example, if Company ABC rallied and the stock value went up to $20, I would still have to repay my loan of 10,000 stocks, which would mean I'm in debt to the value of $200,000. And there's no limit! If the stock value went up to $100,000, you would be on the hook for $1,000,000,000 (by ""you"", I generally mean ""the company you work for""). And at some point, this loan~~ **~~has~~** ~~to be paid off. If your company can't, your company's insurer is on the hook. If they can't, your company gets liquidated, their insurance potentially gets liquidated, and (at least in the USA) the federal reserve is up next. Sometimes the government will literally step in to bail out these companies because of the impact (and because they're all buddy buddy with the rich people who don't like the fact that they gambled and lost).~~

~~You can theoretically hold onto your loan in the hopes that the stock will drop again -- but this has an ongoing interest cost that can be extremely expensive too.~~

~~It's pretty clear that Sang-woo made a really bad futures call which then caused him to resort to fraud and embezzlement in order to cover it up in some way.~~

~~If you wanna learn more about futures, the recent GME debacle is a great example of Wall Street putting huge money into futures and getting fucked on it because the stock price soared.~~

Apparently I'm all shades of wrong here. My bad! Thanks for clarifying.",futures is important basically unlike other stock options what you do with futures is you sell stocks you dont own in the hope that the money you make now will be more than the money you have to pay back later for example 1 i think that company abc is about to absolutely tank in value 2 i want to sell 10000 stocks of company abc at 10 each however i dont actually have 10000 stocks so i take out what is effectively a loan of stocks make my 100000 and then wait for the loan to be resolved 3 if company a does tank and the stock drops to 1 i can then choose to pay back that stock loan at that point to the value of 10000 leaving me with 90000 for my troubles however and this is what happened to sangwoo the risk with futures is that there is no theoretical limit to how much you have to pay back for example if company abc rallied and the stock value went up to 20 i would still have to repay my loan of 10000 stocks which would mean im in debt to the value of 200000 and theres no limit if the stock value went up to 100000 you would be on the hook for 1000000000 by you i generally mean the company you work for and at some point this loan has to be paid off if your company cant your companys insurer is on the hook if they cant your company gets liquidated their insurance potentially gets liquidated and at least in the usa the federal reserve is up next sometimes the government will literally step in to bail out these companies because of the impact and because theyre all buddy buddy with the rich people who dont like the fact that they gambled and lost you can theoretically hold onto your loan in the hopes that the stock will drop again but this has an ongoing interest cost that can be extremely expensive too its pretty clear that sangwoo made a really bad futures call which then caused him to resort to fraud and embezzlement in order to cover it up in some way if you wanna learn more about futures the recent gme debacle is a great example of wall street putting huge money into futures and getting fucked on it because the stock price soared apparently im all shades of wrong here my bad thanks for clarifying
