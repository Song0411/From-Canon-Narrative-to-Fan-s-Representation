# From Canon Narrative to Fan Representation-Squid Game Character Perception Analysis for Thesis

**This GitHub repository contains the code and data used for my thesis, which focuses on a cross-platform analysis (Canon/Reddit/AO3) of five characters from Squid Game. This research examines how each character is perceived and represented by fans across different platforms.**

## About This Repository
The analysis methods and code used for each character are similar, so this repository includes the code and analysis process for only **one characterâ€”Choo Sang-woo** as an example. The code is organized into two main files for convenience:

**Collecting Process**: This file contains the code used to scrape and preprocess data from various platforms, including Reddit, AO3, and Canon sources.  
**Analysis Process**: This file includes the code for analyzing the preprocessed data, such as sentiment analysis, frequency analysis, and visualization of results.  

## Database Structure
For each character, the relevant data is organized into three folders:

**Canon**: Contains the original and preprocessed databases related to the character's portrayal in the source material.  
**Reddit**: Includes discussions and analysis of the character from Reddit, with both raw and cleaned data.  
**AO3**: Contains fanfiction data, including original and preprocessed versions, focusing on how the character is represented in fan works.  

## Research Background
The code and database in this repository are part of my thesis project, which explores the differences in fan perceptions and representations of characters across platforms. The goal is to understand how Squid Game characters are interpreted and discussed by fans on Reddit and through fan fiction on AO3, compared to their portrayal in the original work (Canon).
