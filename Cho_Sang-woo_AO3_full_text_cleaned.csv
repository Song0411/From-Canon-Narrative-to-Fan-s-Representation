https://archiveofourown.org/works/34127974,You are all I long for,rainingallthetime,"“hyung.”gihun looked up at the man standing in front of him, dressed in a suit that probably cost half a year’s worth of his apartment’s rent. it scared gihun to be so near the thing, not wanting to accidentally stain something so expensive. the watch on the other’s wrist must cost more than gihun’s entire existence.“i hope i’m not inconveniencing you. i know that it’s very early in the morning, but i just wanted to see you as soon as possible,” the man spoke, his voice deep and soft. gihun ripped his eyes off of the watch, which is really shinier than it ought to be, and met the other man’s eyes.“uh, no, sir, um, how may i help you?” gihun stuttered, a little scared about why such a man was at his door at this time. the man cocked his head and frowned in confusion.“you don’t remember me, gihun hyung?” oh shit, gihun just offended a man that could probably ruin his life by buying everything he owns and making him homeless. gihun chuckled awkwardly with a tinge of fear.“wait,” gihun refocused his attention, away from the showcase of riches and more towards the actual person. he looked into familiar eyes that were usually hidden behind glasses, eyebrows that quirked whenever gihun was saying something dumb, and a soft smile that not many people used to be able to see, other than gihun. “is that you, sangwoo?”sangwoo chuckled and nodded, “yes, now are you going to invite me in?”“wait a second,” gihun was about to put his hands on the other man’s chest but backtracked at the last minute, remembering that it would probably be a bad idea to ruin such an expensive suit. “butmysangwoo had glasses and nerdy hair, and is…” gihun observed the broadness of the other man’s shoulders and the tapered waist above toned thighs. he coughed, embarrassed at his invasive observation. “he was not this, um, fit.”“andmygihun doesn’t seem to have changed at all.” gihun gave a look of confusion before sangwoo’s face was suddenly closer to his. “you really thought my hair was nerdy?”gihun gaped, thinking that his life was already going down the drain. “well, maybe it was a not too nerdy, but it made you look smart.”sangwoo smirked, “nice save. now, are you going to invite your dearly missed friend into your home?”gihun’s eyes widened and looked behind him, hoping to everything he prayed to that it was not the mess that it usually was. luck was on his side when he saw that all the clothes were in the laundry basket, there was no trash anywhere, and it just looked homely rather than trashy.“ah, please make yourself home,” gihun said, stepping to the side and letting sangwoo walk in.expensive shoes and jacket were taken off and left by the door as sangwoo traversed into the household, looking around at the home that gihun has been living in for a few years now. gihun followed, fiddling with his hands as his apparently childhood friend analyzed his home.“um, do you want a drink? coffee, maybe?” gihun offered.“you don’t need to be so stiff with me, hyung. i’ll have a coffee, though.”gihun nodded, not knowing how to not be stiff with the man when his body is covered in things worth more than his apartment. he told sangwoo to settle down wherever he wanted, which was apparently the couch, while he got the coffee ready. he used the short time to heat the water and strain the coffee to calm his nerves.“here you go,” gihun said, carefully placing two coffee mugs, one with actual coffee and one with his chocolate milk, on the table before taking a seat next to him. sangwoo smiled, gently picking up his cup and taking a sip.“you’re still drinking chocolate milk in the mornings, huh?” sangwoo closed his eyes and felt the heat travel down his chest. he opened his eyes and met gihun’s. “you remember how i like it. thank you.”gihun smiled and nodded before looking away and rubbing his hands on his thighs. “so, what has the pride of ssangmundong been up to?”the more gihun and sangwoo talked, the more comfortable gihun became, until he was as animated and bright as he was before sangwoo left. sangwoo listened as gihun narrated stories of his coworkers, with some being funny and some being so secretive that gihun would whisper it despite being in his own home. sangwoo was smiling the entire time, sipping his coffee as he reexperienced something he longed for for so long.“ah, sangwoo, it’s good to have you back, man,” gihun sighed, bumping his shoulder against the man, feeling like he was younger again. an idea popped up in his head, excited to have his friend back and for him to integrate into his current life. “you should come and meet my girlfriend!”coffee spilled out of sangwoo’s cup mid sip, causing a brown stain to trail down his crisp, white shirt. gihun’s eyes widened and adjusted sangwoo’s cup in his hands so that it stopped spilling.“sangwoo, your shirt! oh, damn,” gihun explained, quickly finding the nearest towel, which happened to be all the way in his kitchen, and running back to dab on the stained shirt.sangwoo came back to himself after feeling gihun’s light touches against his chest, staring down at gihun’s concerned eyes. he grabbed gihun’s hands to stop him, “it’s okay, hyung. do you have a washer?”gihun nodded and was about to offer the other man a shirt to change into in the bathroom while he washed the stained one, but sangwoo beat him to it by stripping the shirt off right then. gihun gasped and covered his eyes, though he did peek through in between his fingers.“what, it’s not like this is the first time seeing me shirtless,” sangwoo smirked.“it’s the first time seeing you like,” gihun gestured to the welltoned muscles on the other man’s torso, “this. are these even real?”gihun moved to rub a finger against one of the lines of sangwoo’s abdomen, seeing if maybe it was just makeup, but nothing came up. it was real, firm flesh, and it flexed instinctively at the feeling of his touch. he mentally shook himself out of his singleminded curiosity about the physique in front of him and reached for the stained shirt.“oh, so sorry! here, let me wash your shirt and get you another one to change into,” gihun muttered, quickly getting up and doing just that. with the stained shirt in his small and humble washer, he looked through his closet for a shirt for sangwoo to wear for now. since he only had a studio apartment, his closet was on the wall across from the couch and a bit to the side, giving sangwoo a perfect view of his back.gihun exclaimed in success as he found a suitable shirt and turned back to sangwoo, who was comfortably leaning against the couch with one ankle crossed over the other knee. sangwoo’s eyes immediately moved up from where he was staring at a lower part of gihun’s body and he smiled up at gihun as he passed a shirt to him.“thank you.” sangwoo looked down at the shirt and paused, remembering the familiar pattern and color. “you still have my shirt?”gihun chuckled and scratched the back of his neck, “yeah, it’s actually one of the best shirts i have. its fabric is really soft but it looks nice enough to wear on most occasions.”sangwoo nodded, mind reeling with different scenarios in which gihun was wearing this specific shirt, as he slid the shirt on. it was a little tight around his arms and chest, but he was still able to button it up. gihun smiled and patted sangwoo’s arms.“wow, the pride of ssangmundong is so handsome, huh?” gihun let go of the wellmuscled arms before he got curious about those, too, and got up. “here, let me change real fast and we can go, i’m supposed to meet my girlfriend in,” he looked at the clock. it was already 9. how long were they talking for? “i was supposed to meet her right now! shit!”gihun flew through his closet and quickly put on whatever he thought looked the best in that split second. when he got back to sangwoo, he was tapping on a mobile phone, making gihun exclaim in surprise. “wow, a mobile phone! you really have everything, huh?”sangwoo looked up and smiled, “almost everything.”gihun chuckled and yanked at sangwoo’s arm, more comfortable with touching the man now that he was no longer threatening him with shirts that could probably bankrupt him if he ripped them.“you’re so handsome that i’m almost scared of letting you meet my girlfriend,” gihun said with a cheeky smile and a blush of happiness, “but let’s go, you probably miss having breakfast in ssangmundong.”the two walked to the restaurant that gihun and his girlfriend usually go for breakfast dates. along the way, gihun pointed out things that changed about ssangmundong, like new crosswalks, stores, and people.“and this is where we used to eat all the time, remember?” gihun stopped at the restaurant, and before he could reach for the door, sangwoo was already opening the door for him. gihun thanked him with a large smile, patting his shoulder as he walked in.gihun exclaimed happily and waved at a woman sitting at a table next to the window, where food was already set out. the woman frowned back but accepted gihun’s kiss to the head regardless. “you’re late,” she said, and then her eyes moved to the man standing close to gihun’s shoulder.“ah, malgeum, this is my friend, the pride of ssangmundong and genius cho sangwoo. sangwoo, this is my girlfriend, the prettiest of ssangmundong, kang malgeum.”malgeum blushed at gihun’s compliment and gave a polite smile and nod. sangwoo repeated it back, though his face was stiff and his eyes were steely. malgeum ignored the discomfort she was feeling from his stare and held gihun’s hand.“i only ordered for the two of us, so we’re going to have to order again,” malgeum said, and gihun nodded before grabbing sangwoo’s elbow and leading him to the cashier, where he pointed out the foods he remembered sangwoo liked. malgeum observed the two of them, eyes following how sangwoo’s body would lean toward gihun’s and how gihun would lean back in response. the two talked closely, gihun animatedly sharing how the chef of the restaurant may have changed the recipes a bit but they were still so good. while gihun was talking to the cashier to order, malgeum was surprised when sangwoo looked back at her, meeting her eyes.sangwoo maintained eye contact as he moved his arm, lifting it up to wrap a hand around gihun’s shoulder as the man happily told the cashier about sangwoo and if the chef remembered the two of them coming by often as children. malgeum gulped at whatever she saw in sangwoo’s eyes before the man turned away, smiling softly at gihun as the cheerful man spoke to him.gihun thanked the cashier and the two men walked back to malgeum’s table, food in hand. malgeum smiled at sangwoo, “so, you are the famous sangwoo. i feel like i already know you, with how much gihun liked to talk about you.”gihun shyly chuckled and shot off into another story that malgeum had already heard before, laughing politely whenever her boyfriend laughed brightly. she looked up at sangwoo’s face, catching a glimpse of a soft smile on his lips and a warmth in his eyes before he looked away from gihun and met her eyes. immediately those eyes became cold and the curve of those lips turned sharp.after an excruciating 45 minutes of gihun talking while oblivious to the tense bubble around malgeum and sangwoo, gihun sighed and patted his stomach.“i’m sorry, i gotta go to the bathroom, malgeum, can you keep sangwoo company for a bit?” gihun pecked her cheek before smiling and standing up to do his business. malgeum watched as her boyfriend left, taking with him the only semblance of comfort she had in this shitty situation. she awkwardly chuckled and turned, looking down at her food.“kang malgeum.”she looked up when her name was called, eyes wide as she met the dark eyes of her boyfriend’s childhood friend.“age 26, highest level of education is ssangmun girl’s high school and a course on becoming a seamstress. worked several jobs as a waitress and is now a novice seamstress at a lowend clothing shop.”malgeum’s eyes widened and her brows lifted as anger started bubbling in her chest. did this man do a background check on her? where did he get this information from?“87 million won in debt after taking out a loan for taking courses on becoming a seamstress and opening your shop. currently paying for what you can’t afford to pay by siphoning money out of your loved ones’ accounts,” sangwoo leaned forward, elbows on the table and hands clasped under his chin as he trapped malgeum in an allconsuming glare, “including your boyfriend’s.”malgeum trembled, sweat dripping down her forehead and her stomach a raging swarm of anxious butterflies. the only thing she could hear was her heartbeat, and she didn’t realize that gihun had returned until he patted her shoulder.“so sorry about that you guys, you know, duty calls,” gihun chuckled, gathering food into takeout boxes for him to eat later, whistling happy tunes and oblivious to the iciness in the air. when he finished, he patted his thighs and looked at the other two, finally noticing the stillness of them.“are you guys okay? did something happen on the news?” gihun looked up at the radio on the counter next to the cashier, but didn’t hear any emergency broadcast.“gihun,” sangwoo called, bringing gihun’s attention back to him, “i really must go now, my boss has been wondering where i have been and he has become impatient.”gihun nodded, standing up to hug his friend goodbye. over gihun’s shoulder, sangwoo met malgeum’s eyes again, who could only tilt her chin down and clench her hands against her thighs.when gihun patted the soft fabric against sangwoo’s back, he remembered that sangwoo had left his jacket and shirt at his apartment in their rush to leave and meet his girlfriend.“your jacket and shirt, sangwoo!” gihun exclaimed, retreating from sangwoo and concernedly looking over the humble shirt that sangwoo was wearing. “i can quickly go get them”sangwoo clasped his hands around gihun’s elbows, “it’s okay, gihun. i am fine with wearing this.” he leaned forward and whispered into gihun’s ear, “i’ll come by tonight to pick them up.”sangwoo turned his attention to the girl still sitting down, “it was nice meeting you, kang malgeum.”with one last smile to gihun, sangwoo walked out of the restaurant.gihun was sadly sipping a bottle of soju when his doorbell rang. he wiped his face and walked over to the door.when the door opened, sangwoo was greeted by the sight of gihun with red cheeks and nose, puffy eyes, and sojuscented breath.“what happened, gihun?” sangwoo asked, concern dripping in his voice as he brought his hands up to wipe the tears that were gathering on the corner of gihun’s eyes. sangwoo led the distraught man inside, locking the door and settling gihun onto the couch with a comforting hand against his back.“malgeum, she broke up with me,” he sobbed, dropping his head into his hands as sangwoo rubbed his back. “she said that i wasn’t successful enough to support her and the family that she wanted.”sangwoo clenched his hand against his thigh as his other hand continued to comfort gihun. “that woman had a terrible personality. it’s best that she was removed from your life, anyway. you don’t need a parasite like that.”gihun looked up into sangwoo’s eyes, face red and wet, “but i loved her so much, we were talking about child names and futures just a week before, how could she do this?”sangwoo huffed out of his nose and brought his other hand to rub a thumb on gihun’s hand, “she was a golddigger, looking out for nobody except for herself. you deserve someone who cherishes you and takes care of your needs as well, not just someone who takes and takes.”gihun sighed, knowing that sangwoo was probably speaking the truth but not being able to feel any relief from his heartbreak. “you wouldn’t have to worry about women leaving you for that, at least. you have all the money and more to be able to support your wife and loved ones.”sangwoo sighed, “well, it isn’t a wife that i’m looking for, anyway.”gihun frowned in confusion. sangwoo smiled and lightly squeezed gihun’s hand.“gihun, can i kiss you?”gihun blinked in surprise, wondering if maybe the alcohol in his system was making him hallucinate. “eexcuse me?”“let me kiss you, please.” sangwoo kept an amicable smile on his face as gihun sputtered.“you’re asking to kiss me?” gihun repeated, surprised at sangwoo’s request. sangwoo nodded, and nodded again when gihun repeated the same question, emphasizing that it was in fact gihun that he was asking to kiss.“but, why would you want to kiss me?” gihun mumbled, tears having been stopped after a bomb was dropped in his brain at sangwoo’s request.“gihun hyung,” sangwoo brought his face closer, and he stopped when he felt like he would be overstepping gihun’s boundary, “i’ve always wanted to kiss you.”gihun blinked again, mouth gaping, and he was silent for a long, long time, searching in sangwoo’s eyes and only finding warmth, sincerity, and a bit of desperation. gihun wondered, how long has sangwoo been feeling like this?in his silence, sangwoo patiently rubbed gihun’s back, waiting for gihun’s answer. he wasn’t exactly scared about his answer, knowing that in the future, he would ask over and over again until his answer was a yes.“damn it,” gihun cursed, snagging the bottle of soju on the table and taking a large gulp. sangwoo’s eyes widened at the movement as gihun slammed the bottle down.“kiss me, sangwoo.”gihun’s heart felt like it would explode out of his chest as sangwoo swooped down, slotting their lips together. gihun felt electricity in his veins in a way that he has never felt before. sangwoo’s lips felt warm, comfortable. sangwoo’s lips moved against his, seeming to suck pleasure into gihun’s lips and causing gihun to squirm when he felt tingling in his lower area.sangwoo brought his hands up to gihun’s jaws, guiding gihun’s head to an angle that deepened their kiss. gihun moaned as sangwoo’s lips sucked on his lower lip, moving forward and trying to do the same for sangwoo.gihun instinctively opened his mouth at the feeling of something soft and wet pushing against his teeth, and sangwoo surged forward, bringing his hand to the back of gihun’s neck. gihun gasped and moaned, hands clenching against the other man’s shirt as his back met the couch, the other man devouring his mouth as he laid back, legs spread out on each side of sangwoo’s hips.sangwoo’s tongue explored everywhere, finally being able to taste what he had longed for for so long. his heart soared, searing the taste and the sensations into his memory as gihun became a mess underneath him.gihun flinched when he felt something hard and hot against his pelvis. “ssangwoo,” gihun muttered, turning his head away and causing sangwoo’s lips to hit the side of his cheek.“gihun,” sangwoo’s gravely voice was dark and heated, causing a shiver to run down gihun’s spine. gihun opened his mouth to say something, but the only thing that came out was a shaky moan when sangwoo expertly shifted his hips, rubbing his hardon against the one growing in gihun’s own pants.“sangwoo!” gihun cried, hips flexing upward at the arousal searing through his body. sangwoo thrust his hips downward, gyrating in a way that made gihun sob in overstimulation. this was the first time that gihun had ever felt this way, had ever felt this hot and overloaded and desperate.sangwoo brought their lips together again, drinking in gihun’s moans as his hips rolled against gihun’s. gihun’s hips reflexively moved upward, not being able to control his movements as pleasure shot through him. he wrapped his arms around sangwoo’s shoulders, desperate to hold on to something or else he felt like he might fall despite being safely tucked in sangwoo’s arms.gihun’s moans became louder and louder, so passionate that they eventually became silent. his hips stuttered, back arching and hands clasping at sangwoo’s shirt as he felt his orgasm rip out of him. he felt heat explode everywhere, sensations flooding his entire being, and if it weren’t for sangwoo holding him, gihun felt like he could be floating.sangwoo grunted, absolutely mesmerized at the sight before him. gihun’s head was tilted back, his mouth open and bitten red by his kisses, cheeks attractively red and an expression of overwhelming bliss painting over his features.sangwoo’s thrusts became uncontrollable as he watched gihun’s face, feeling all the muscles in his body clench as he came as well. he panted above gihun, chest heaving and arm muscles struggling to relax as the pleasure echoed through him. sweat dripped down his brow, and the droplet escaped his face and hit gihun’s slack face under him.“gihun,” sangwoo muttered, bringing his hand up to lightly pat at gihun’s cheek. at the lack of response, sangwoo chuckled and got up. he slid his arms under the other man’s knees and back to bring him to the bed.gihun shot up in his bed when he awoke, face red and sweating. he looked around, almost wondering where he was for a second when he realized he was in his own apartment. he glanced down, realizing that he had no clothes on except for a clean pair of underwear.gihun patted his chest and shoulders, wondering if what happened last night actually happened. did he really do all that, or was that a fever dream that the soju in his system cooked up?in the corner of his eyes, he saw a note on his bedside table. he picked it up, hands trembling as he opened the note to familiar handwriting.i had to go to work. call me if you need me, i will see you later.gihun’s eyes went back to the table and saw a box with a ribbon sitting there, and when he quickly picked up the box and ripped it open to see the contents, he saw a new mobile phone. when he opened the phone, he saw that there was already a contact in it.gihun gulped and clicked the contact, mouth dry.the phone picked up.”hyung.”"

she can even keep some chickens. she loves those things, we had one that she wanted to keep for eggs, but, there was a time where we couldn’t get any food, and well… she was so sad after it was gone, that it was a little silly.”sangwoo stared at the back of his head, waiting, but gihun stopped talking for a moment, seemingly finished with his answer.gihun shook his head, “ah, damn, that’s never going to happen though, not with my grades.”“what if i got them for you?”gihun stopped his bike in surprise. he turned around to look at the boy behind him, who is just in his last year of middle school, not even in high school yet. he thought he’d see an amused face, something that would show that the other boy was just joking, but what he found was all seriousness. “well, it’d take more than your perfect scores in middle school, kid. you’d probably have to go to a top tier university for that kind of wish, something like snu, my little friend.”gihun blew at the other boy’s face, causing him to annoyedly push his face away and reaffix his hair.“i’m only one year younger than you,” sangwoo muttered, redfaced and ears hot while gihun just laughed back.when gihun told sangwoo that he’d have to go to snu, he didn’t expect the boy to actually do it.“ohhh, my little sangwoo is all grown up now!” gihun watched sangwoo’s mom pinch the young man’s cheeks, though she had to reach quite high to do so. he snickered, causing sangwoo to shoot him a glare.“a smart grown up, too,” gihun‘s mother commented, causing gihun to roll his eyes as he flipped the meat on the barbeque.they were at a restaurant, celebrating sangwoo’s acceptance into seoul national university before he had to leave. gihun himself was also celebrating landing a job at a motor company, and it was originally just going to be him and sangwoo, but the mothers wanted to come along, too.“oh, but gihun, too, he’s going to be a working man!” sangwoo’s mother started attacking gihun’s cheeks, but gihun put a stop to that by saying that he needed help with the cooking and sangwoo’s mother naturally did just that.“so, hyung.” gihun turned towards sangwoo as the younger man started speaking, “will you wait for me?”gihun cocked his head, “for what?”“i’ll get you a big house, one with a room for cars and a field for chickens,” sangwoo continued.gihun chuckled, “oh, that? that was such a long time ago, i didn’t even think you’d remember that.”“that’s so sweet, sangwoo! but you’ll be able to do a lot more than that once you’re done with university,” sangwoo’s mother cooed, putting cooked meat on his plate. sangwoo stayed silent, grabbing tongs and placing meat on gihun’s plate.after they finished eating, the mothers started chatting with the cashier and the boys waited outside.gihun put his hands in his pockets, rocking on the heels of his toes.“hyung.”gihun looked up, taken back when he saw sangwoo closer than he expected.he looked serious but nervous, older than how he actually was. the red lights of the neon signs harshly lit up one side of his face while the other side looked soft under the street lights.gihun knew he was going to miss his friend, and wouldn't know who to bring to cyber cafes or who to talk with long into the night. maybe one of his other friends, but he was just so used to it being sangwoo at his side.gihun smiled up at the younger man, who seemed so much taller than him despite being only a centimeter higher. he grabbed the other’s hand, “i’m gonna miss you, sangwoo.”sangwoo’s eyes became infinitely softer, “i’m going to miss you too, hyung.”gihun smiled brightly, crinkled at the corner of his eyes, and he nodded before moving to let sangwoo go.before he could completely let go, sangwoo’s hand grabbed his forearm, and he was suddenly pulled forward.gihun was engulfed in the firmest, warmest hug in his entire life, sangwoo’s arms wrapped so tightly around his waist that it felt like he was going to be broken in half. gihun laughed and patted the other man’s back, settling into the hug and wrapping his arms around his shoulders.“wait for me,” sangwoo whispered, warm breath tickling his ear. gihun shivered, felt sangwoo’s arms tighten one more time before he was let go.“don’t make me wait too long,” gihun replied.—6 years latergihun groaned after hearing the doorbell ring a first, then a second time. it was 7 in the morning, and usually he didn’t need to get up until 8:30 at most. he cursed under his breath at the insistent doorbell, quickly pulling on pants from the floor before stumbling towards the door.hair a mess, only in a pair of pants and an undershirt, he opened the door and squinted at the morning light. his eyes widened at the man on the other side, dressed spiffy with a perfectly tailored suit and handsomely styled hair.“hyung.”"
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34448059,Delivery,rainingallthetime,"sangwoo was sitting on the edge of his bed, glaring down at his trembling fists.it was the time of year where he had to experience his rut, and it was as inconvenient as any other times he had to experience this. he was barely able to focus, he felt angry all the time, and his cock was embarrassingly hard all the time. he wasn’t able to go out like this, but he wasn’t even able to get his head together enough to do any actual work. it was one of the worst times of the year.his nose twitched, smelling something faint, sweet, familiar. he must be so deep in his rut that he was imagining things, manifesting scents that his instincts were calling for. it has been a long time since he had assisted gihun with his heat, since the omega now had heat suppressants that he could afford with his new job at a motor company. it left the alpha wanting, desperate almost, so much so that he had spent nights with his cock in his hand for hours on end as he recollected the memories of gihun underneath him.there was a sudden knock on his door, bringing sangwoo back into reality and away from whatever desires he was hallucinating into being. it must be his roommate, who would usually come into the room despite sangwoo being in a rut. as another alpha, he understood what sangwoo was going through, so he didn’t bother him much. he probably just forgot something in the room.sangwoo didn't really care about the presence of the other alpha as long as they wore scent blockers, so sangwoo stood up, his feet heavily dragging on the floor, as he opened the door for who he thought was his roommate.his nose was suddenly under siege with the exact scent that he wanted to smell most in the world at the moment, and it made his abdomen clench as if he was punched in the gut. he leaned his forearm against the door frame and blinked a few times to clear his blurry vision, though his scratched up glasses didn’t help much.“sangwoo are you okay?” his ears were blessed with the voice that he adored so much, and that wasn’t good, not at all. not in his current state, where he had to clench onto the door frame for dear life in order to stop himself from immediately grabbing gihun and taking him on the floor.“gihun hyung, what are you doing here?” sangwoo ground out, fingers clenching down on the door frame so tightly that his nails were painfully digging into the wood, but he focused on that pain and tried to ignore the urges resounding in his body totake him.“this isn’t really the best time, gihun.”gihun had a concerned expression on his face, his eyes tracking the sweat dripping down his friend’s face and the tense, trembling shoulders. not to mention the intense pheromones that were being emitted into the air, and all the messages that were floating around in those scents made gihun blush.“sangwoo, you’re in rut?” gihun asked, though it was obviously true. he didn’t need to ask, not after seeing the outline of sangwoo’s member under thick sweatpants.“yes, gihun. i’m sorry you have to see me this way and that you travelled so far to see me but it really isn’t the best time,” sangwoo mumbled, moving to close the door, his brain swarming with thoughts ofhe came all the way here for me, my omega, he needs me, need him“wwait!” gihun started, causing the alpha to freeze, his face a mere crack in the door. “um, sangwoo... do you need help?”sangwoo was as still as a statue as he processed gihun’s question. it made gihun nervous, with how silent his friend became, and maybe he was going to say no, which would only sting a little bit, but gihun would understand. “well, you’re always helping me with my... issues… so i wanted to, i don’t know, offer help too? you probably don’t need me, though, there were a bunch of omegas around the dormitory, it’s actually pretty surprising to see so many in one place when we’re supposed to be so rare”sangwoo suddenly opened the door again, surprising gihun out of his babbling.“you’ll stay with me, even when i’m like this?” sangwoo asked, his voice hesitant and his knuckles white on the door knob. he was barely able to think, he only had enough of a mind to make sure that gihun knew what he was going to be getting into.gihun scoffed, “well, yeah, you would stay with me, too”“i’m going to fuck you until you cry. and then i’m going to keep fucking you. is that okay?”gihun’s eyes widened, and he felt like a deer in the headlights at the sound of sangwoo’s vulgar speech. was it the rut that was making him speak with no inhibitions? is this what sangwoo was thinking in his mind while he was usually speaking so politely and properly?gihun gulped, and he nodded his head, allowing the alpha to pull him into the room that was practically a sea of sangwoo’s scent.experiencing sex with sangwoo outside of his heat felt like a whole new experience. he didn’t have the heat clouding his mind or a pliancy in his bones, and he was able to feel and actually pay attention to everything sangwoo was doing. sangwoo would nibble at places that gihun didn’t even know would cause his dick to twitch so hard. when the other man flicked at his nipple, he felt tingles in his chest that travelled to his navel, and his brain was able to process the feeling and it felt like he was a virgin all over again.since gihun didn’t have the natural lubricant that would usually be present during his heat, sangwoo had to find an alternative to make sure it wouldn’t hurt for him, and his rutaddled mind decided that the solution was to dig his tongue deep into gihun’s ass.sangwoo was trying to shove his tongue so deep, it seemed like he was searching for something, which he probably was. his alpha instincts were probably searching for lubricant, an indication of an omega in heat that would ensure a successful mating, but gihun wasn’t in heat, and he was left to suffer under the pleasurable ministrations of an alpha who tried his very best to taste something that wasn’t there. gihun covered his mouth, embarrassed at the sounds he would make now that he was no longer being distracted by his heat.eventually, gihun was lying on his back and clenching at the sheets, wrinkling them with a sweating hand, and his other hand was so tight around the back of sangwoo’s neck that it almost hurt the alpha.when sangwoo first sunk his cock into gihun, who was already so saturated with the pleasure soaking his entire being, his eyes got so wide, expression confused, as if he didn’t know what was happening, as his cock twitched and cum splattered strongly between them.“oh, my baby boy,” sangwoo’s voice was deep, low and croaking, as the heat around him tightened around his cock, “you just came from taking my cock, gihun?”sangwoo looked even more excited than before, his presence becoming so intense that gihun felt small as he looked up with teary eyes. sangwoo had a smile on his face as he whispered more filthy things that made gihun close his eyes shut, the alpha’s voice ricocheting around his head and the overwhelming ecstasy making it feel like he was floating. “you’re made for my cock, gihun, you feel so perfect. you’re perfect for me, gihun. you’remine.”gihun was already so overstimulated, but sangwoo was just getting started. he had so much energy pent up, it was his rut, after all, and gihun would have to stay for a few more days. tears gathered in the corners of his eyes as his body bounced with the alpha’s thrusts, his cock weeping between them, and he felt something catching against his rim. this was the first time ever experiencing a rut with an alpha, so he had never experienced knotting before. he was a little excited, to be honest, with the arousal that was searing through his veins.soon enough, the large bulb pushed through gihun’s opening, so wide that it was almost uncomfortable, before popping inside, and the shape of it stretching his insides felt more satisfying than uncomfortable, like an itch being scratched. it pressed harshly against his prostate, causing gihun to twitch and shift his hips, but every movement would make it grind against his pleasure spot over and over.sangwoo sighed above him, staring down at gihun, who eventually squirmed himself into another unexpected orgasm by struggling on his knot. gihun had tears in his eyes, his cheeks red and lips wet with drool, and sangwoo couldn’t resist dropping his face onto gihun’s and tasting the inside of his mouth. gihun moaned and wrapped his arms around sangwoo’s neck, a tired sigh escaping his nose.eventually, sangwoo’s knot went down, but not before gihun had taken it upon himself to fall asleep. sangwoo let out a sigh as he sat at the side of the bed, gihun knocked out next to him, legs and shoulders tucked into a blanket like a hermit crab.sangwoo can imagine that under that blanket were bruises on his hips and cum dripping down his thighs, bite marks that didn’t break the skin dotting his chest, shoulders and neck.it soothed the alpha in him, made his mind clearer and refreshed. now with his instincts taken care of, he had to take care of his physical needs. first, his parched throat.along the way to the fridge, he picked up the snack wrappers and empty water bottles littering the floor. he tossed everything in a trash bag before going into the fridge and taking a very much needed sip of bottled water, and then his eyes spotted gihun’s backpack next to the door.sangwoo put the water bottle down, contemplating as he stared at the bag. sangwoo couldn’t resist looking. he had to try, he couldn't take another half of a year without experiencing gihun in the throes of his heat, tired of the many lonely nights he had with his dick in his hand and the omega on his mind. he leaned down and shuffled through gihun’s bag, trying to find where he had his heat suppressants and what kind of pills they were. he hoped that they looked like the tylenol that he had in his bathroom cupboard. his hand bumped into a box, one that had a strip of fabric wrapped around it, and he brought it out, revealing a small box with a ribbon.“happy birthday, sangwoo,” gihun mumbled. sangwoo turned around in shock, seeing the omega sleepily looking at him with squinting eyes.sangwoo gulped and looked down at the box, opening it to reveal a slim case. he took the case out and put the box down. he opened the case to reveal a new pair of glasses, ones that looked stylish yet professional. he lifted the glasses up, observing the light reflecting off the smooth glass, and placed them on his face. his vision was clear, the most clear it has been ever since his glasses got scratched up.he looked down at gihun, who was smiling up at him with sleepy, warm eyes. gihun spread his arms, and sangwoo fell, sinking down onto the bed and embracing him.he had to tell his roommate that he would have to find another place to stay for a few days."

shithole. with a dimwit like me.”sangwoo’s blood was boiling. his chest ached with a rage that crawled up his throat and made him grind his teeth.gihun’s eyes reflected the same anger. “is that also my fault?” gihun’s breath was hot, like he was breathing fire but he was only breathing out spiteful words. the air between them was vibrating with tension, a wave that reverberated their anger at each other. sangwoo wanted to choke this ungrateful man. he wanted to wrap his hands around that dingy little neck and wring it until the other’s face was red and purple. gihun was thinking the same thing.but sangwoo felt his blood boil more and more, and the adrenaline from the previous game was still coursing through his veins. he wanted to release the energy that was flooding him as he stared down into gihun’s hard eyes. he was a livewire, ready to burst, ready to push gihun down and give him what the ungrateful bastard deserves. he clenched his jaw, thinking and thinking about what he was going to do.a loud beeping interrupted sangwoo’s thoughts.“we sincerely congratulate and commend you for successfully making it through five games. you’ve now become the finalists, and we’ve prepared a special gift for you. before we present the gifts, please change into the outfit we prepared.”boxes with the damned circle, triangle, and square wrapped in gaudy pink ribbon were presented. and then they were led away.the soldier closed and locked the door to the bathroom. sangwoo and gihun were left alone, together with their circle, triangle, square boxes.gihun walked away first, shuffling toward the stall farthest from the entrance. sangwoo watched him go, his heart beat loud in his own ears.over his heart beat, he was still able to hear the shuffling of gihun’s clothes as they dropped to the floor.he took a step forward, then the steps turned into a brisk walk, then the walk turned into a kick, and the door of gihun’s stall slammed open, startling him enough to make gihun drop the pants he was about to put on and trip as he tried to back away from sangwoo.sangwoo grabbed gihun’s shoulders and the back of gihun’s head slammed on the wall.gihun gasped in pain and sangwoo dove at the chance, his mouth angry and demanding, a hand on the back of his neck keeping him still as sangwoo devoured. he pressed his body against gihun’s, keeping him captive with his heavy weight, making gihun taste the fury and the heat that he felt. it was a battle of teeth, lips greedily trying to suck gihun’s breath away.gihun was frozen until he tasted blood in his mouth. he didn’t know whose blood it was, but the iron bitterness was enough to break him away from his stupor and push sangwoo back, causing the man to slam against the opposite stall wall and giving gihun enough room for him to stumble out of the stall.but his legs were trembling, and gihun could barely put any distance between them before sangwoo grabs the hair on the back of his head and pulls him back.“i know you remember this, gihun,” sangwoo’s breath was hot against gihun’s ear, his chest heaving against gihun’s back.gihun clenched his eyes shut, shaking his head. “what are you doing, sangwoo? we need to conserve our energy.”sangwoo scoffed, wrapped his arm around gihun’s chest, and felt the other’s heart beat like a hummingbird. “i hated myself, the way i felt. about you. i couldn’t get it out of my head, couldn’t find anybody to distract myself from it. i felt like a worse son than what i already was.”gihun tried to struggle, tried to bury the memories that were being resurfaced, but it was like trying to put a bandaid on a broken pipe.he remembered them. their time together. the laughs, the intimacy, the dreams shared between them, and it all started drifting away at the same time sangwoo left for snu. gihun felt proud for him at first, but then he felt lonely, and then sangwoo was gone for so long that it felt like he wasn’t going to return again. then gayeong was born.“you didn’t wait for me, gihun.” sangwoo growled, tears that were trapped for years and years starting to flow again. the anger, both the old and the new, made him squeeze gihun tighter against him.“you left.” gihun grunted out. “you think i didn’t wait? i waited, and waited, but not one word from you!”gihun laid in bed, waiting for his phone to ring. waiting and waiting and waiting. he doesn’t know how many times he tried, but every call he made would go unanswered.gihun surged his head forward, painfully ripping sangwoo’s hand out of his hair and trying to shove sangwoo’s arm off his chest. but sangwoo kept his iron grip around him. gihun didn’t know where sangwoo got this strength from, but he wrapped his other arm around gihun’s waist and dragged the both of them to the sink on the other side of the room. gihun was pushed forward, his hands slamming against the mirror and narrowly avoiding breaking the mirror with his face.sangwoo pressed his hips against gihun’s, trapping him against the sink, kicking gihun's legs apart. he leaned over, bringing his mouth next to gihun’s ear again, “i was always thinking of you. even after you betrayed me, you were on my mind. and i was so angry.”sangwoo never usually uses social media, choosing to focus more on his studies and his endeavors, especially during his last semester. so he never knew what gihun was up to, until his mother asked him what present he was going to bring for gihun’s wedding.sangwoo roughly shoved his hips forward, grinding himself against gihun. gihun winced in pain from the hard sink being pressed against his front.“i was angry at you.” sangwoo kept one arm around gihun’s neck and used the other to get soap from the dispenser. “i was angry at your wife.” he slipped his hand down, underneath gihun’s underwear. “i was angry at myself.”gihun gasped as sangwoo’s finger roughly breached him, his hands clenched into fists against the mirror.sangwoo’s breaths were hot against his cheek as he felt gihun’s tight heat again after so long. “i was angry for a long, long time. after everything i did for you, and you left me.”all gihun could do was breath and clench his eyes shut as more of sangwoo’s fingers joined the first. they were searching, and gihun whimpered when they found what they were looking for.at gihun’s whimper, sangwoo’s fingers worked harder, more purposefully, and gihun tried to escape those fingers. he tried leaning forward, standing on his toes, but sangwoo only leaned forward with him, following his heat.“i loved you, gihun.” gihun shook his head, denial on his tongue. why would he abandon him if he loved him?“i didn’t abandon you.” gihun didn’t even realize he spoke aloud, his brain barely functioning with what sangwoo was doing to him. all gihun could do was writhe until sangwoo removed his fingers.and then something hotter, larger, familiar was replacing the fingers, and he didn’t have time to panic before gihun felt sangwoo entering him. it didn’t hurt, sangwoo made sure of it, would always make sure of it.gihun could barely breath as sangwoo slid deeper, the pressure familiar and something he wouldn’t have thought he missed until he felt it again.sangwoo was all the way inside, and he exhaled a trembling breath at gihun’s heat, something in his chest aching from how right it felt. fuck, he missed this.he started moving, his hands like heated steel on gihun’s waist, and he moved in the angle he remembered he liked. he felt like the anger he had, the one that he wanted to take out on gihun, was insubstantial compared to the dread that had built up throughout the games.sangwoo remembered seeing the first dead bodies in the first game, scared he’d be seeing gihun as one of them. he remembered sitting in a tub, depressed and thinking about ending it all, that nothing was worth it anymore. remembered his anger resurfacing in the second game as he thought about gihun’s betrayal, leading him to do the same.gihun asked him if he would have pushed him if he was the one in front of sangwoo in the fifth game. gihun, whose sentimentality outweighed his selfpreservation. sangwoo wouldn’t have pushed him. he knew that he wouldn’t have needed to push him. and that thought scared him.sangwoo’s movements were soft, but precise, hitting the spot that made gihun’s blood rush down and create an unbearable heat in his lower half.“sangwoo.” gihun’s wavering voice and his hand grasping sangwoo’s took him out of his thoughts. sangwoo looked up, ignoring the hot trails staining his cheeks as his eyes found gihun’s in the mirror. he felt his cock twitch when he saw gihun’s face, his pink cheeks, watery eyes, redbitten lips. sangwoo’s heart trembled, and he wrapped his arm tightly around gihun’s chest and slid his hand down to his cock.gihun gasped and moaned as the movements became harder, more desperate, sangwoo drinking in gihun’s scent as he panted and exerted his strength to thrust as strongly as possible. to bring them both closer, and closer, and gihun was moaning more loudly and sangwoo grunting lowly and then gihun was getting tighter and tighter.a gasp echoed in the bathroom. heat was leaking in between sangwoo’s fingers. sangwoo’s thrusts stuttered before his cock gave one final twitch and heat flooded gihun.panting was the only sound in the bathroom as sangwoo held gihun tightly against him. his nose buried into his neck as he fought to catch his breath. gihun was faring even worse as he choked on his saliva, sangwoo rubbing his chest as he coughed it out.the sweat was cooling on their skin, and sangwoo extricated his arms. gihun was lying against the sink as sangwoo cleaned him. he continued laying there, breathing starting to become calmer as the other fetched his clothes. he felt clammy hands pulling him up. finally he ripped those hands off of him.gihun weakly glared at sangwoo, who stared back as he held gihun’s shirt out to him.“you could have told me to stop. you know i would have.”gihun grabbed his shirt out of sangwoo's hand as well as everything else sangwoo brought and quickly put everything on before rushing out of the bathroom.“let’s go home.”“gihun. i’m sorry.”"
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34133302,At ease,catch21,"sangwoo wasn’t all that surprised to see people die during these games.distraught, yes,of course, every single time. he would flinch, his heart would pound in his fists, jaw clenched so tight his teeth threatened to shatter at the next shot while his nails pierced the skin of his palms in anticipation.nothing a few billion won couldn’t easily fix.there are only a small handful of things that couldn’t be fixed by 4 billion won, and that’s despite accounting for a margin of error, because he can’t think of any.pay off the debts. agree on some kind of deal with the corrupt fucks at the police department. take care of his mother, try to be the son she thinks he is. buy a decent home, some nice suits. cigarettes. get a therapist, trick them into thinking all of this is simply a recurring nightmare. it probably will be by the time he gets out.there’s no room there for another winner in this scenario, regardless of whether the host would even allow it. he has always been all or nothing – that’s how he got here in the first place. however, his best bet is to remain a team player for as long as possible, while it remains beneficial to him. enjoy the connection, the mutual protection, until it comes down to two. then, if a weapon ever finds itself in his hand, he will make it quick. between those thick eyebrows, just beneath the soft curls.“hyung,” ali says, in a quiet voice that’s not quite a whisper, disrupting sangwoo’s train of thought, “are you okay?” he seems genuinely concerned, his eyes darting around briefly to ensure he didn’t draw undue attention.a bitter laugh escapes sangwoo before he can swallow the emotion, but he quickly covers for himself with a cough.no, the thing that took him by surprise wasn’t the dogeatdog nature of desperate, lawless humanity. he expected as much. worse, even.what shakes him to his core is the overwhelming kindness and unconditional support ali has offered to people who are strangers to him, people he has no reason to trust.like sangwoo.all the lights are out, save for the gentle light emanating from the grand prize hanging from the ceiling. it’s barely enough to be able to make out that almost all the remaining contestants are sound asleep in their beds, but more than enough to be able to make out every detail of ali’s face. the warm, sunlike glow of the solution to all their problems is reflected in ali’s expressive eyes and carefully outlines his form in a subtle gold.right. he’s been staring. though ali seems to be looking at him, too, more often than not.still, he feels… caught.“yes.”yes, i was just staring at you, he almost says like the desperate and sleepdeprived shell of a man he is, the words still dangerously close to spilling right out, just to see what would happen. “yes, i’m alright.”ali’s eyebrows knit together in something more akin to a pout than a frown, not satisfied sangwoo’s answer. “i don’t believe you,” he admits, though his tone turns the admission into an apology. he looks up at sangwoo, pleading. “if something is bothering you, hyung, please let me know. being distracted tomorrow could mean...”the sentence remains unfinished.but it’s not hard to imagine what would come after.yeah, he would surely die if his mind wandered during any of the games. it’s not his worstcase scenario, but he’d do some nasty things to avoid it. he doesn’t exactly foresee this happening again, however.“hyung,” ali complains quietly, gently urging him to speak.“i’ve been thinking about kissing you,” he says, which is much more severe than staring and not exactly true. his mind hasn't gone there just yet. there have only been flashes, in dreams and waking life, of lingering hands and comforting touches, stored away in haste, before they could come to mean anything.ali frowns, confused, visibly hesitating. he almost starts to say something, then repeats the word ‘kiss’ to himself. probably to figure out if he heard that right, and what it might be if he hadn’t. there’s a smirk pulling at the edges of sangwoo’s mouth that he doesn’t resist, for once.this was already worth it,he thinks, purely on instinct. he loves seeing people flustered.the haze of exhaustion isn’t entirely unlike the haze that comes with drugs or alcohol. common sense, verbal filters and other inhibitions may abandon you. it’s a good excuse when you’re looking to indulge potentially unwise impulses.so…he places a hand on ali’s clothed shoulder, reassuring and firm, the same way he’s done so many times before. except when he releases his grip this time, he slips his hand beneath ali’s collar, moving up his throat until he reaches the jawline. he slides his thumb right over, a caressing motion across stubblecovered, plump cheeks, while his other fingers occupy themselves with impossibly soft curls at the nape of his neck.the next game may be the last. if ali comes to hate him for this, it can’t last very long. their lives are always at stake, and sangwoo intends to protect his own first and foremost. disgust and rejection could make this a lot easier on him. no, it’s not a gamble without merits. still, he can’t tell whose heart is beating, nor can he tell what emotion belies its offbeat rhythm.after a single, calculated breath, sangwoo closes the distance between the two of them – leaning in and pulling a surprisedlooking ali towards him, capturing his mouth with his own.it suddenly occurs to him that he almost can't remember when he last kissed someone outside of questionable bathroom stalls and cheap motels.the sensation of ali’s stubble scratching his face as he moves isn’t even entirely unpleasant, though that may be the mild, irrational euphoria talking. right now, everything is soft and warm and comforting. with ali’s bottom lip between his own, he can feel him start to give in to the kiss, a barely audible whine escaping somewhere in the back of his throat. what a beautiful sound.there’s no need to come up for air, though one of the more sentimental voices in his head suggests he would happily drown in this, but he’s slightly dizzy and needs to regain his composure after that, so he pulls back with significant reluctance.when he looks at ali, he’s…smiling. the corners of his eyes suggest he does it quite often. it doesn’t age him at all. sangwoo’s smiles don’t usually tend to reach that far, but ali’s joy is particularly infectious.the smile is a little awkward, flustered, embarrassed, but there’s nothing uncomfortable about it.“i don’t really understand why, but”somehow, it’s the positive reaction that temporarily fills him with a sense of foreboding “i’m glad to share this with you, hyung.”“me, too.” before he is immediately robbed of it by ali leaning over him and kissing him this time, the role reversal even sweeter.they manage to get through the night uncaught and unharmed. their stolen kisses remain a wellkept secret.…when morning comes, so does the announcement for the next game.they’ll be playing in teams of two."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34203805,Taking Care of Him (Again),vergeriisms,"hands come up to scrub at bleary eyes, chest heaving lightly with each panting breath that gihun drew from his lungs. he was sweating even though the temperature of the 'dorm' was regulated perfectly. his shirt felt too tight, and too soft. each shift of his body dragged the fabric over his sensitive skin, making his nipples peak beneath them.it was hard trying to keep watch over who was around him when he could hardly see through his blurry vision. there were many more alphas in here than omegas, or even betas. it was certainly scary to be in heat with all of them around. 101 in particular scared the living daylights out of him. the thought of being sniffed out by one of them...they would probably take turns. or perhaps they would all fight over who gets to breed gihun first.just the idea of being pinned down by an unruly, bulky alpha made him whine, eyes squeezing shut as he tried to ignore the chubbing dick in his pants, or how he'd gotten wet between his asscheeks.""gihun."" a low voice murmured behind him. he could smell the pheromones already. his cock hardened further almost instinctively.before he could speak, the alpha was crossing in front of his vision, sitting in front of him on his thin mattress. sangwoo. gihun figured he had recognized that smell.""sangwoo...um...why are you here?"" he asked, his whispers fading in and out as he did his best to resist the urge to display himself for the alpha outright.gihun could tell that he knew, of course. the pheromones sangwoo was releasing seemed to be telling enough. though most of the other players around were asleep, it would prevent anyone else still awake from coming over and trying to start something.""you stink, okay?"" sangwoo rubbed his hand over his face. ""i recognized the smell."" his nostrils flare slightly, jaw clenching as he drew in the mouthwatering scent.in gihun's age, as omegas do, his heats began to get less intense, less mindnumbing. though he wasn't truly that old, only on the precipice of showing signs of omegan aging.""it it's not something we really need to worry about. i'll be perfectly fine through the night. besides, who would want to get with an old omega like m"" he was unable to finish his sentence, for sangwoo grabbed him by the shirt, and yanked him forward, sending him halftumbling into the alphas lap.a complaint shot from gihun's throat, though it died there when sangwoo's hand sealed over the omegas mouth. ""keep quiet, would you? you're announcing to the whole damn place that you're an omega in heat."" he grumbled, gritting his teeth.gihun was confused, at first, but once he started truly paying attention, he realized that there was some sort of...shadowed figure, watching them from only a few beds away.it made alarm bells go off in his head, and he clinged close to sangwoo, eyes now trained on whoever it could be.""...come on."" sangwoo untangled himself from the omega, standing from the bed with gihun clinging to his side.""where..."" he follows wherever the alpha goes, unsurprisingly, not even noticing just where they were headed until sangwoo was knocking on a door.""he's in heat. let us go to the restroom, unless you want a fullout war in here."" sangwoo's gaze was steel, staring almost blankly at the masked man standing behind the door.there was nothing but silence and staring for a few moments, before the redclad man was opening the door. gihun clung tight to sangwoo, a shudder trickling down his spine when the masked man leaned in to sniff him as he passed.gihun hardly remembered much after that, until sangwoo was backing him into a shower stall, smelling like pine and sweat and something much deeper and darker.""s sangwoo?"" his knees shake slightly, blurry gaze watching the alpha with a softness, a pliancy that made sangwoo grit his teeth, nostrils flaring as he drew in the omegas scent.""you're always talking about how you're getting old, gihun. so one should do it, yeah?"" sangwoo's straightforwardness pulled a needing whimper from gihun. there was certainly a wet spot on either side of his pants.it felt like he had faded from sentience again for a moment, because all of a sudden, he was turned, face pressed against the shower wall. his pants had vanished, and sangwoo's strong hands were gripping tight into his skin.gihun's breathing picked up, and he surely would've collapsed if not for the alphas hands, holding him tight and in place. no amount of struggling would move him away or closer to the alpha.sangwoo pulls apart the omegas ass, spreading him wide open. his hole was absolutely leaking, spreading slick down his thighs from just how much there was.it smelled the heaviest here. sangwoo could feel his mouth beginning to water. he took one more glance at the back of gihun's head, before snapping his hips forward.sangwoo, while not being the biggest or strongest alpha, surely did not lack in the length department. gihun felt absolutely speared open, legs shaking, mouth open though no sound escaped. he surely would've fallen if it wasn't for the alphas hands...or his cock.the first thrust has gihun moaning like a whore, hole already spasming around sangwoo's dick. the alpha, in turn, groans, settling into a punishing pace. perhaps not the fastest, but each slide home was rough, and hard, and that was certainly enough for the omega right now.gihun was so wet that sangwoo nearly thought he'd slip out. he made sure to tell the omega that, delighting in the shameful whimpers that came in response.sangwoo was never one for dirty talk, but in his opinion, gihun truly deserved it. trying to just wait out his heat all night, when someone would surely just notixe by morning, if not before then.the thought of another alpha staking claim on gihun made him growl, low and dark, right next to the omegas ear. instincts swimming in his head, gihun keens, muttering 'alpha, alpha, alpha' in such a watery, desperate way that sangwoo simply couldn't help himself.his thrusts became erratic, one hand leaving the omegas hip to seal over his mouth, keeping all those whorish noises contaimed as best as possible as he hammered into the pliant body before him.each thrust had gihun seeing stars, and he was almost overwhelmed. his sensitive body was now too sensitive, eyes rolling back as he choked on a whining shriek, holding sangwoo's cock in a vice grip though the alpha was able to continue thrusting anyways, making gihun squeal through his orgasm.the alphas pace only barely lightened. he was chasing his own orgasm now, fucking gihun through the mindnumbing feeling of oversensitivity. it didn't take him too long, thankfully. though his feral mind wanted him to so badly, sangwoo resisted the urge to mark and claim and truly breed gihun. that couldn't happen, not in here.""ah ah alpha,"" gihun whimpered as sangwoo slid his cock out, watching as his cum began to leak from the omegas stilltwitching hole. the wall in front of him was spattered with his own cum, though not nearly as much as the alpha had pumped into him.""gihun."" sangwoo murmured, pulling his pants up before helping gihun strip the rest of the way.""let me help you clean up."" the alpha offered with a slight, gentle smile. it made gihun shudder before he nodded, flushed and embarrassed that sangwoo would really want to help him out after just helping him in a different way.the alpha stepped halfway out of the shower stall. he didn't need to clean anything up, there was no reason to get wet. he shedded his jacket, before reaching inside of the shower to turn the water on.gihun watched with stillblurry eyes. now he was just tired. the omega yawned, rubbing his eyes as he shuffled into the spray of the water. it hit him in the face, and he sighed pleasantly, enjoying the warm water to soothe himself.he nearly forgot sangwoo was even there before he was being turned, his back now facing the alpha. it made him nervous, and flustered. especially when his ass was spread again. he could feel sangwoo's eyes staring, before two fingers came to probe at his entrance.gihun squeaked, legs shaking slightly when those fingers slipped inside, before spreading him wide open. it made him arch, mouth agape, eyes nearly rolling back. at least it got the cum out faster.moments pass before sangwoo finally removes his fingers, wiping them off on the back of gihun's thighs. it brings a shiver from the omega, still so sensitive from the fuck they had finished not even 5 minutes ago.the shower moved quickly after that, with the alpha washing his hair, making him nice and relaxed, as well as very sleepy. sangwoo had to dry him off nearly all on his own. not that he minded. this was far from the first time he had taken care of gihun through his heat.stumbling slightly, gihun finally made it past the doorway that lead back to the large, shared dorm. everyone was still asleep, thankfully. and it didn't seem like anyone rioted over the smell of gihun's sheets.""sleep with me tonight. your bed stinks of omega."" sangwoo whispered to gihun, who didn't do much other than nod and yawn.settling into the slim cot, sangwoo pulled gihun flush against his chest. the omega didn't seem to mind, too tired and satisfied to react negatively to the warm, strong body of an alpha encompassing him. sleep came easily for both of them."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34387306,Inseparable,Derniere,"love would be too strong a word to describe what cho sangwoo felt for seong gihun, but no one seemed to understand that, as the silly jokes continued. his mother, since he was even younger, had asked him to bring him lunch as compensation for taking him on his bicycle to the cram school. his classmates immediately gave up on insisting for him to play after school as soon as he said that gihun had come to pick him up. the only person who seemed to be certain he didn't love him was gihun himself. which was very good, his problems would be much worse if it were the other way around. just for starters, sangwoo would lose his ride home. not that he had a problem with that, it was justeasierif he was accompanied, no matter who it was. of course, he had never said that to anyone, as it wouldn't change anything.""hey, boygenius!"" gihun greeted as soon as he saw sangwoo leave through the school gates. sangwoo simply nodded in return, grabbing the helmet from his bag and putting it.""you came earlier, hyung.""""i found a new shortcut that has three more slopes!"" he said excitedly, with a big smile. sangwoo felt his stomach lighten, which, he deduced, was his mind mimicking the sensation of going downhill. very imaginative.""that's cool,"" he commented climbing onto the back of the bike. it was such an improvement, as his old one could barely hold both of them without making some horrible creaking noises. sangwoo suspected it had been bought just so gihun could come pick him up from school.""i know, right!"" gihun in the other hand, wasn't wearing a helmet at all. sangwoo was sure that in almost a year of rides, he had seen him wearing one of those only four times. ""anyway, my mom said she was going to make some fried chicken for dinner, do you want to come and play… solitaire?"" gihun made a strained expression, he thought solitaire was an old man's game, even though it was sangwoo's favorite.""i'm busy today.""""oh, come on, sangwoo! you never let me treat you with food!""gihun accelerated the bike when sangwoo had barely sat up straight. he always pedaled faster than was safe, which made sangwoo have to squeeze him for more safety, it was the lesser evil. but this time, he seemed to be going even faster.""y'know, when you grow up and get rich, how am i gonna guilt you into buying me a motorcycle if you don't owe me anything?"" he asked in a serious tone, which made sangwoo laugh.""i'd never buy you a motorcycle, hyung. i don't want you to die.""""you're no fun!"" the older one huffed, upset. ""a jetski then!""""that's just the sea's motorcycle!"" sangwoo stated, still laughing. without noticing, he pressed his cheek against the other’s back to suppress the sounds. he couldn't see his face, but he was sure the older one was trying to pout.""just come and have dinner today, okay?! you can study whatever boring stuff you want!""""yeah,"" he smiled quietly, going back to his normal position. ""yeah, okay.""""nice!""okay, he might not have been entirely right earlier. he would miss those moments if it was someone else, but still, it's not love.~~~in his late middle school years, one of the most entertaining things sangwoo could do was to lecture gihun before his exams, even though he was one year older. as he was top of his class, there was a bunch of classmates who wanted his help on studying and he really had tried. but none of them could follow his reasoning – was it really that hard? well, gihun didn't understand it either, but there was something endearing about it that the others didn't have. that was a feeling sangwoo preferred not to overthink. furthermore, he had a much greater freedom to hit gihun's hand with a plastic ruler when he was distracted than he had with his other colleagues.""respect your elders!"" he would say while pouting and stroking the red spot on his hand.it was his favorite form entertainment, so he didn't quite understand why people were shocked when he turned down a date with a girl to go help gihun after school. he didn't know for sure if he was going to have fun on the date, but he sure as hell was going to have fun studying. and it even helped his independent studies. it was a win/win.of course, he didn't tell the older one that. he would scold him for not going on the date and it left sangwoo with a sour taste in his mouth. because it implied that if the situation were the other way around, he would choose the girl. he was irresponsible like that! losing hours of productive studies by walking around spending money on a girl!sangwoo didn't tell her to schedule another day, or even offered her to join them. it didn't feel fitting. she wasn't his type anyways. his mother totally understood him, telling proudly all the matchmakers that her son was very exigent.~~~gihun got himself a girlfriend on his first month of high school.""good,"" was all sangwoo could manage say after silently listening to the eldest tell the long story of how he had accomplished this act.sangwoo found out that, as confident as he was in his still developing business smile, it was of no use when he was sad. except he wasn't sad! no! he was just shocked. perhaps a little bit disappointed by external causes totally unrelated to this conversation.""sangwoo, is everything alright? looks like you saw a ghost,"" gihun asked a little confused, but a smile still played on his face. which, somehow, made sangwoo pissed.""i'm great!"" he waved his hands, shoving the subject away, trying to keep his voice as serious as possible. ""so, you're walking home with her from now on.""""what? no, she has to take the train.""well, that did sound like music to his ears, but the bitterness was still there.""must be difficult,"" sangwoo commented. ""dating a girl who lives far away.""""it's not that far.""""it seems far away. you don't even like taking the train.""""it's not like i hate it.""""you said several times it's always packed.""""i think in this situation it's worth it.""""is it worth getting tired? it's dangerous at night.""""well, she can come to my house too, or we can go elsewhere.""""and issheup to it?""""sangwoo!"" gihun complained. ""could you be happy for me?""no, he thought. instead, he just let out a long breath, suddenly hurt.""i'm sorry, if you are happy, then i'm happy.""gihun squinted his eyes, studying his expression suspiciously. and then he smiled, totally satisfied, his eyes almost closing and a few wrinkles appeared at the corners. sangwoo's heart plummeted. suddenly he was entirely aware of his own movements.""but, i, hm, must go now,"" sangwoo spoke too fast, gathering his notebooks and planning his way out the bedroom.""so soon?"" gihun pouted.""yeah, first friday of the month. i have to help my mom with the inventory and, hm, stuff.""perfect excuse.""okay, hm, same time tuesday?""""yes– i mean, maybe, you know. if i don't find a girlfriend first.""and before even getting an answer, he rushed out of the room, then the house. and he barely answered his own mother as he made his way into his room. suddenly very energetic. he couldn't stay still for too long.gihun got a girlfriend, it makes sense. he always knew it would happen eventually, he accepted it. and why wouldn't he? the truth is that he neverreallythought about it. if he did, then maybe he would not have freaked out like that.and he wasn't able to picture why exactly he was feeling so threatened. you can have a girlfriend and friends, most people do. sure, their time together would significantly decrease, but it wasn't like he would be casted aside. i mean, could he blame gihun? there were things that only a girlfriend could offer. and sangwoodidhave other friends, people on his grade that he could spend time with, and they werealright.maybe all the chit chat got in his head. and after years of hearing that they were inseparable he let himself be carried away. became dependent.so just stop being dependent, cho sangwoo. he thought over and over while cleaning his room. he needed to get his hands busy, just as busy as his mind. and his heart.he did not have abandon issues. so it couldn't be that. he hasn't met the girl to dislike her, so it couldn't be that. he didn't envy him, so it couldn't be that. he didn't love him, so it couldn't be th–oh.""oh, no,"" he said out loud, letting the broom fall from his hand and a hollow noise echo against the wood.oh, but that's just what it was. not envy, but jealousy. jealousy because someone quietly stole what he took for granted. and it felt awful.was he really in love? did his affections go as far as a physical attraction? was he up to doingthose thingswith gihun? he never thought about that. and with silent realization he concluded that yes. yes, he did. he gladly would, he thought with a hint of shame.because he had a nice smile, and was learning how to cook properly. he was tall and liked to take care of others – a quality that sangwoo never had. because he made him laugh and always introduced him as a genius to whoever crossed their path. yeah, it was natural that sangwoo would fall in love with him.it was natural, but it was not okay. gihun was his best friend, he had a girlfriend and he was a man. three huge reasons to shove this feeling deep inside and hope for it to choke to death. it could ruin him, his career, the dreams he has for himself, and his mother. everything he worked so hard for until this day.and gihun didn't even like him back, so, there was– therecouldn'tbe a future for them. he lived until now just fine without any romantic relationships, and he liked to think that it was a very fulfilling life. yes.a seed can't become a tree without water. just distance yourself until it isn't a threat anymore.~~~it was an ordinary day at snu for sangwoo. it was his senior year, and he had managed to keep his score high, so high that he became first on the list for valedictorian. he even joined a study group with people who actually understood the assignments just as well as he did. college definitely was a challenge, but a mental challenge, one he could overcome, orhasovercome, as his grades would punctuate.yeah, for a while, he was doing fine.until he saw the white envelope on his mail pile. a wedding invitation, from seong gihun. his immediate instinct was shoving it aside, preferably on a trash can. but somehow, he couldn't do it. so, he did the exact opposite and opened it carefully. and it was just the usual stuff, family names – girlfriend number four was the lucky one, – a date, the local. but as he glanced the back, there was some poorly ink pen written note. sangwoo's heart sunk.hey, genius boy, would you please give me the honor of joining my wedding... pretty please?and it shouldn't feel as painful. it had been over two years sangwoo and gihun exchanged words with one another. and sangwoo was very satisfied with how little he managed to think about gihun on a monthly basis, but it seemed as good as fool’s gold if seeing his almost runic handwriting still affected him this much.there was no way he was showing up on that wedding, no matter how many letters his mother would be sending to him on the next few weeks trying to persuade him. but he would, at least, send the happy couple some flowers. or even better, ask his mother to choose them, as he wanted to think about it for the least amount of time as possible.~~~eight years passed before sangwoo bumped into gihun again. he managed to get his mother to travel wherever he was on most important holidays for quite some time, longer than he thought he could, actually. over time, with promotions, business travels, and the money he earned, he convinced himself that he chose not to come back because ssangmundong had become too small for him. a little white lie wouldn’t hurt anyone.nevertheless, the seong gihun infatuation had been completely overcome since a few years before. he wasn’t young anymore and was able to understand that having a successful career was more than enough to make him content with life. so, when he got out of the taxi directly in front of his mother’s store, he really wasn’t expecting to bash the car door on someone, or that the person lying on the ground was gihun.well, he didn'trealizeit was gihun until he was helping him up and hearing that voice say, “you got tall.”his hand almost slipped as he tried to display the appropriated amount of surprised and happy that someone who ghosted their childhood friend should.“seong gihun,” he said as he slightly bowed, the name tasting weird as it came out of his mouth. he heard a soft laugh while doing so.“oh, you don’t need to dothat,” gihun said mockingly. “you’re the pride of ssangmundong, in here you should only bow at yourmother.”sangwoo laughed awkwardly. of course, he shouldn’t, but he hoped that it would signal they are not as close as they used to be. and gihun would take the bait and never show up again.but wait, he had overcome this. so why was he so nervous?“so, i bet aunt cho finally convinced you to come back for chuseok?”“that’s… exactly it.” the younger one said, not surprised at all that everyone would know he was coming back.“i’m happy.”and there was that damn smile. now the wrinkles were way more evident because they were real ones. he had a bit of a beard, which sangwoo was sure wasn’t intentional, he probably just forgot to shave. and his hair was longer, it really suited him. and he said he was happy to see him again,happy. well, it could just be politeness speaking, but the gihun he remembered, did not really care for politeness.“my son!” his mother exclaimed, walking way too fast for a woman that age. he bent his head so she could properly touch his face and analyze it. “as handsome as ever!”“mom…” he muttered; she would always say that.“and gihun, your packages are on the counter.”“yes, ma’am!” the man answered rushing in.“and here i was, dreaming about you bringing my future daughterinlaw for chuseok!” she said half serious.he gave her a defeated smile as she finally took a step back, waving him to come inside. and he did as she told, taking his lonely bag with him, to the apartment on the upper floor. he wished to walk past unknown, but just as he took the first step on the stairs, he felt a press on his wrist.“do you want to come and have dinner tonight?”“what?” he asked with a dumb voice.argh, keep it together!“i was going to invite you to my restaurant, but then i thought ‘hey, some alone time with the chef must be better,’ right?”‘alone time with the chef’, was the reason i’ve spent ten years away from this place.“sure, why not,” he answered by instinct. and gihun smiled back at instinct, and suddenly if felt like he never left, like it was his last day before going to seoul and he was secretly drinking from gihun’s hidden bottle. god, he must have such a dumb expression right now.“it closes at 10:30, if that’s alright with you?”“great!” sangwoo waved at him, finally going upstairs. he pushed the door with his elbow and made his way into his old room, placing down his bag and looking around. it hasn’t changed much, except maybe the curtains, and the lightbulb. such a nostalgic place.he took of his blazer when he went to the kitchen.“need some help?” he asked, he wasn’t much of a cook himself, but he would always ask.“it hasn't been half an hour since you got here and seong gihun is already stealing you from home again,” she said while flipping some vegetables on the pan.“it wasn’t like that,” sangwoo tried to defend himself.“yes, it was! you boys were inseparable, all the time whispering and–”“studying,” he said, but he knew what she meant.“say what you want to say, my son,” she had a fun smile as she gently elbowed him. “and i don’t need help, it’s the least i can do for my handsome son.”he always felt a twinge of guilt to hear her say things like that. as if he was the perfect son. he wasn't, never would be. and he could never give her a daughterinlaw or grandchildren like she wanted. the most he could do was dodge the questions people would ask and hope they continued to see him as an example of a hardworking man.an entirely different twinge of guilt was saying ‘yes’ to dinner with gihun. it wasn't as if he thought anything was going to happen, he was married, had adaughterand most of all: he didn't feel anything for him, other than, at best, a brotherly love. it was the only explanation for why he didn't hate him after he'd been gone for years. a brother does not stop being a brother even on the other side of the world. but sangwoo felt things a brother should never feel. but he could play along. it was the least, in fact, he could do.that's what gihun would say to his wife before he left, even though it was late at night: i'm going to meet an old friend. and she would believe him, because gihun never gave her any doubts. he was that good.and that thought lingered throughout the afternoon, even during lunch with his mother, and the short walk he took to greet the neighbors – he had to do that one time or another. he'd spent so much time dreading meeting gihun again, but it was easier than it looked. besides, it wouldn't be forever. and soon he would be on a flight back to seoul.from the beginning, he knew that his feelings for gihun weren't bad, just impulsive. but, he thought, just today, knowing everything was under control, could he give into them. they were two friends and one happened to be in love with the other. it was more common than you might think. sangwoo, being a little selfish, also deserved a little familiarity every now and then and that smile… it was like being at home.thathe could admit.so, he took his time in the shower – he had just gotten off a flight, it was the least. took his time choosing clothes, and even his shoes. and if he wondered if he was trying too hard, he just remembered that in business, appearance is everything, and it suddenly became very simple.at 10:38pm his cellphone rang, unknown number.“hey, snu,” said gihun on the other line. “i’m not telling you how i got your number.”“that’s okay,” sangwoo simply said.“just sent you a text with my new address, i’m waiting.”“yes, that’s okay.”but then the call ended, and he understood what those words meant. his new address. dinner wasn't going to be at the restaurant, it was going to be at hishouse. which also implied the presence of hiswife, whom he had never met. of course, he was going to be with his wife, he wrote that note on the wedding invitation because he wanted sangwoo to meet his wife. his wife. his wife. suddenly sangwoo wanted to call it quits, say he had a stomachache or something. but he could feel that if he said that, gihun would come over to give him some soup, or some boiled vegetables. which would be better than going to the house where his perfect family certainly lived. but no. he had made a commitment and would go through with it.he looked at the address and swallowed his pride. it was close by, only two blocks from his own house. which meant less time to think about getting back home.sangwoo took one of the small gift boxes he brought as a souvenir for the family friends. he picked the one with chocolates, which, he deduced, gihun’s daughter would like.most of the small business were closed at his hour, and the lights were dim as he made his way towards the building. over all, ssangmundong’s streets didn’t change much. there were a few new buildings and business, but the aura remained. it was late september so his hands felt cold against the silver box, actually, his entire body felt like shivering.he knocked the door when he finally arrived. gihun opened it so fast it felt like he was resting against it ever since their call.“good night,” he said while taking of his shoes.“wow, i’m feeling a little underdressed right now.”it was true, it seemed they were both going toverydifferent places. but sangwoo just shook his shoulders. gihun looked good in his everyday clothes.“i brought this for your daughter,” he handed the wrapped box with a ribbon.“oh, how nice!”“i’m sorry, i couldn’t find a fitting gift for your wife,” sangwoo stated, suddenly uneasy. but gihun didn’t seem uneasy at all, in fact, he had a funny expression. disturbingly similar to the one he made all these ago, right after telling sangwoo about his girlfriend.“then it’s your lucky day, since i’m not married anymore,” he said waving his hands.for a moment, sangwoo wondered if he was hallucinating.“what?” he must’ve had such a blank expression.“i’m not married anymore,” he huffed a smile. “it’s been over a year now.”well, he could blame no one but himself for missing thatsubstantialpart. after years of monosyllable answers and hums, his mother understood that he wasn’t interested in gihun’s life anymore. but a divorce? all things considered; he was surprised she didn’t spend hours talking about how couples shouldn’t just give up like that. ah, but it did feel good to hear those words, even if it wasn’t right.“i’m sorry.”“it’s okay, it’s okay!” gihun shoved the subject aside. “come in and let me feed you.”sangwoo immediately relaxed, following him into the kitchen. at least, it seemed like the wound was closed.“y’know, watching me cook is always a show aside, but since it’s late, i didn’t want to keep you waiting, sooo–” he opened the oven. “i brought it ready from the restaurant.”the roasted chicken looked delicious, to say the least. and sangwoo went to a ton of good restaurants in his life.“my special for the genius of ssangmundong,” he said with a pleased grin.“that’s impressive.”“and you haven’t even eaten yet, that’s a good sign.”time seemed to fly by for a couple minutes. gihun made them a full pan of rice and the sides he remembered sangwoo to like from their childhood. and, god, it had been a while since he ate comfort food like that. his mother had made him lunch, but he was barely able to appreciate, being lost in thoughts. he finally understood why so many of his coworkers seemed to want a housewife. usually after getting home, he would just bath and eat some instant noodles before going to sleep. butthiswas entirely better.soon, they finished dinner and moved to the couch, gihun bringing a new bottle of sake along with him.sangwoo wasn’t much of a talker, so he listened as gihun talked about his most funny customer service’s experiences, some anecdotes about his daughter – whose name was gayeong – at her school, an innocent comment about his postmarriage love life – or the lack of it. and some superficial gossip about the restaurant next to his.“but you can’t tell that toanyone!” he whispered as sangwoo took a sip of sake. he didn’t even have anyone to tell it, but even so he said.“i would never.”“y’know, sangwoo, i feel like i’m doing all the talking,” he said with half a sigh.“what do you want to know?” he offered, since his head was a little light due to the alcohol.“tell me about your job, your coworkers.”“they are alright, i guess.” sangwoo commented. “but… it isn’t enough for you.”“hell no.”“most of the older ones are very family centered. i do have a couple subordinates and they usually manage not to mess up their tasks. from time to time we have some company parties, but that’s all. i’m not really close to anyone.”gihun stood a moment, thinking about his apathetic answer.“no one special?” he questioned with curiosity, spark in his eyes.the younger one smiled sadly, if he only knew.“i don’t have the time.”“ouch! you’re so cold, sangwoo. i mean, you don’t have to take advise from me, but life is better when you have someone to share with. getting married is–”“then why didyouget a divorce?” sangwoo asked, feeling cornered.the answer came quickly.“some things happened close to gayeong’s birth. we were never able to overcome it.” gihun explained. “now you.  why do you isolate yourself?”sangwoo started to regret those glasses of sake he had. it felt hard not to vocalize the thoughts in his mind. he should’ve known as soon as he accepted the invitation that they would eventually talk about his tenyear run. and he felt too eager for reactions. he wondered what kind of face gihun would make if he knew how much of sangwoo’s life had resolved around him. how many times he had looked at other men seeking for any similar reaction, and failed miserably.“feelings are problematic.” he lectured religiously, as it felt like an understatement. “there’s no way to control it. my life would’ve been so much easier if not… if not for them.”“easier doesn’t mean good.”“it meansfine, i would be satisfied with fine.”“what are you running from, sangwoo?”“nothing! damn, gihun, can you leave it be?”a long silent pause installed between them, both staring at the walls. sangwoo sighed, he was too old for storming out like that. he gathered courage to apologize and hopefully leave, but when he finally turned his eyes into gihun’s he felt unable to voice anything, unable to move. he saw that he had not believed any of his rehearsed lies, that he was giving up. and that was the only thing… sangwoo couldn’t afford.“why did you never come back, sangwoo?” he asked in a soft breath.“because i love you.”that’s it, he finally said it. he said it with his eyes closed, while looking away, but he said it. and he felt small, because suddenly if felt too real. being back in town, meeting him, thisdinner. this proximity felt overwhelming. he heard a sigh.“that’s a relief! i thought you’d say you hate me or something.” he heard what it seemed to be gihun talking, but he couldn’t be sure, since his eyes were still shut. “hey, sangwoo.”but he didn’t respond.“sangwoo, look at me,” he felt a hand tentatively touch his own. “look at me,” a soft squeeze.then he looked. even in shock, he moved his head and opened his eyes, adjusting to the light. he found gihun looking at him, with such a sweet– such a happy smile.“i love you,” he said in a whisper. “i always have.”“huh,” the younger one mouthed. “i–i didn’t mean likethat.not as a friend.”“me neither.”“but you… got married,” the words rolled out of his tongue.“and you never came back.” the taller one said, not as an excuse, or an explanation. “i thought you were way out of my league. i still do, to be honest. but if the universe wants to give me a gift, i’m not going to deny it. not anymore.”a gift? it sounded more like a miracle. or a fever dream. gihunlovedhim? the same way he did, and for so long? the feeling of their hands intertwining felt too real, too warm. gihun seemed to be waiting patiently for a response, but the younger one felt unable to speak.then, sangwoo, kissed the back of his palm. staring right into his gaze. there was so much tenderness in there, so much care, that sangwoo stood blinded for some time. the hand around his lightly squeezed.it felt like ssangmundong was some sort of time bubble. seoul could change overnight, it never stopped, but right here, was still the same. he was overwhelmed by the heat. suddenly, he pushed himself closer, as close as he could get being as cautious as he was. their hands still intertwined. he cupped gihun's cheek and felt it hot. he couldn't wait longer.so, he kissed him.and he melted realizing that gihun was kissing him back, moving his head closer. the hand on his cheek moved into his neck, touching the soft longer hair in there.the kiss was significantly slower than his heart wanted to, but he was just testing the waters. it wasn't his first kiss, but it was close to it. it was the only kiss that has ever mattered.and he didn't care that if he was discovered he could lose his job. he could get another one, maybe on the states. he had received some job offers, but refused them to stay closer to his mother. but, dang it, he'd bring her with them and it would all be worth it. sangwoo would rearrange his whole life around this kiss if he had to. so there could be others.gihun pressed his tongue against his lips and sangwoo eagerly opened them. the lemon from the roast chicken was still strong in his palate. their hands separated as sangwoo pressed his fingers on his lower back, pushing him even closer.as the kiss started to heat up, sangwoo felt the soft brush of the other man's beard against his face and it didthingsto him, grasping his long hair at what gihungroaned.""sangwoo, let's go to bed."" he whispered kissing the corner of his mouth. he stood up, pulling sangwoo along with him as he leaded the way into his room, but not being able to avoid be pushed against the dinner table, then a wall. tripping over almost everything in their way before reaching the said bed.sangwoo must’ve lost his blazer along the way because the only thing separating their chests were the shirts that they were already getting rid of. in an outburst of courage, he started unbolting gihun’s pants, seeing just how his belly contracted at the slightest touch.the started kissing gihun’s neck as he slid down his own pants. casually touching his lower – and naked – back. that room smelled just like him, like his hair. it felt inebriating, like a fog which he was glad to never leave. and one time or another he would hear those quiet sounds, when he would tentatively bite his shoulder, and his whole body wouldshiver. in fact, when he pinned gihun against the bed, he felt like he could come only from the sight.“the lube is on the top drawer.” gihun said hurriedly.sangwoo frowned in confusion. didn’t he say he hasn’t been with anyone else since–oh, he did it himself.he couldn’t stop the heat that spread across his face. the lights were out, so gihun couldn’t provably see it, but he could definitely sense it, since soon their faces were united again. sangwoo would bite his lower lip, and gihun would grind against his leg as they made a mess in the bed. sheets and pillows on the floor.they fell out of sync as gihun turned over, having a sudden change of heart, planting a soft kiss on the other’s cheek, quickly going down until his face almost touching his– there was no time for sangwoo to even assimilate what was happening when gihun swallowed himfully.he nothing but snorted at that, holding onto the headboard for dear life.he drags his fingers through gihun’s hair, guiding him on a pace that would not embarrass him to death. it felt so warm, he had to refrain from moving, seeking any sort of extra relive from the huge amount of lust he felt seeing how gihun’s jaw would strain around him, hit the back of his throat. he could feed the vibrations of his breathing as he moved his head up and down.saying he found gihun very attractive was a complete understatement, his whole beauty pattern revolved around him. the shape of the eyes, the hair, the nose, the smile, the body type and theheight. sangwoo did love how slightly taller the other one was, and that he was skinnier than him. so being sucked by him was the equivalent of a living wet dream. he wouldn’t last long.“gihun– ah, slow down.” he heard a hum in acknowledgment. “stop–stop.”he clearly saw his cock slip out of his mouth, he forgot what he was going to say. the image would be glued to his mind for a long, long time.“you look cute,” gihun commented making his way up again. sangwoo frowned, that’s not exactly what he wanted to hear, but he quickly changed his mind as gihun slowly stroked him. he extent his hand, searching for the lube on the halfopened drawer, finding it easily enough. he gave the older one a dirty look.“do you want to finger yourself for me, hyung?”the question seemed to bring up gihun’s shyness, sangwoo grinned. “or i can do it for you, if that’s what you want?”“if we’re being honest here… i’d like you to do it,” he decided, putting up a straight face. he’d always do that when he was deflecting, but sangwoo wasn’t going to argue now. instead, he just slicked two of his fingers and proceeded to press a first into him. they were in a good position, with gihun on top of him, pressing his head against his shoulder, he could actually feel his penis touching his belly as he rocked a second finger inside.his sweet spot was found rather quickly, as gihun started to rock his hips into his hand, and god, it made all sorts of things with sangwoo. he wasn’t very fond of foreplay – or maybe it applied to doing it with anyone else who wasn’t gihun –, but he’d be happy doing this all night, edging. he inserted a third finger after a couple minutes and it went in relatively easily, not to mention the way those hips moved into them impatiently. he was ready.and gihun appeared to understand it at the same time. raising his head and locking eyes with the younger one. sangwoo turned over, finally being on top of him, standing in one elbow as the other hand placed his cock at the other’s entrance. they both gasped when it finally started to go in, little by little. gihun wrapped his legs around his waist, swallowing a groan and it was almost too much to handle. seeing how he grasped at the last sheet on the bed, adjusting to the sensation, sangwoo went all in.he ran his fingers through gihun’s hair, removing it from his face, he had his mouth opened, eyes closed, and it was the most beautiful sight sangwoo has even seen. gihun opened his eyes and rolled his hips all at once. sangwoo understood what he meant.stopping the shallow thrusts and finally giving both what they wanted. he took a firm hold on gihun’s tight, giving him the leverage, he needed to give into him hard. he could feel him pressing against his cock from all angles, sucking it inside, and every time he pulled in, he felt a new wave of pleasure stronger than the last one.they kissed each other messily, pressing their foreheads together as they babbled nonsensical things their brain wasn’t able to even articulate. the bed would hit the wall as the sound of flesh against flesh filled the room. gihun breathed irregularly and sangwoo could taste him, his sweat dripping down his neck. it was a cold night but the room couldn’t feel warmer. gihun, his gihun felt the same. any dream or fantasy he ever had wasn’t even close to the actual touch. his mind wasn’t able to emulate the feeling of their fingers intertwining, of their mouths being connected by a string of sakeflavored saliva. sangwoo wrapped his fingers around gihun’s erection, masturbating him imitating his every stroke.“sangwoo, i– ah! i’m–” he moaned disconnectedly.“yeah, me too…” sangwoo interrupted, in a half gasp.as he finally let go the other’s leg, he noticed the dark bruises his fingers left behind, and he felt captivated by them. he wanted to kiss them, worship them, the physical marks of what they were doing. he’d do it later. he took his free hand and cupped gihun’s jaw, signaling for him to open his eyes, he did it in a heartbeat, but only barely. he pressed his cheek against his hand during a particular strong thrust.“sangwoo, now– please,make me feel it.”he didn’t need to hear it twice. fucking him into the bed as he came inside. he was still moving, his hips and hand unable to stop before gihun came, splaying over chest and sangwoo’s fist. they laid beside each other catching their breath after what it seemed to be the best orgasm of their lives. their shoulders still brushing against one another.sangwoo had such a silly grin on his face he felt quite happy for the dim light. they have done it, the pleasure still spreading through his entire being. he felt overjoyed, in awe at the impossibility of everything that happened in a single day and never being so thankful to his mother for guilting him into coming back home for the holiday.“so, do you still want that motorcycle?” sangwoo questioned, halfserious.“sangwoo, you’re so cold! you’re fine with me dying just after we had sex?” he made a dramatic pause, lovingly elbowing the other. “i’ll take the jetski, though.”sangwoo sappily hummed in response, watching as gihun nested his head against his shoulder. he started stroking his hair as tenderly as he could. he’d love to sleep like this every night until he died, his brain starting to work on how to make that possible.“how much would you fancy moving into seoul?” he asked out of the blue. he knew it wasn’t the healthiest thing to make big life choices after –amazing– sex, but he felt too tired to rationalize that.gihun gaped.  “is that a serious question?”“if you want it to be.”“gayeong does love seoul,” he shrugged it off.“your daughter,” sangwoo remembered. kids were never really a subject he thoroughly thought about. since he was in love with the samemanfor his whole life. but he came to the conclusion that he had nothing against it, raising a little girl. “does she look like you?”the question seemed to please gihun very much.“she’s smart like me.”“oh, poor thing.”“hey!” he protested. sangwoo only laughed. “you can meet her, if you want. she’s coming back for the last day of chuseok.”“yeah,” sangwoo kissed the top of his head. “yeah, i’d like that.”and just like that, with his arm around gihun’s shoulder, sangwoo let himself relax. truly relax, after all those years. the feeling that it would all be fine, felt odd to his usually pessimistic brain, but it was inevitable. he felt happy, and in love with his favorite person who also loved him back, after all those years.he allowed himself to fall asleep, wishing the next night would end up the same way."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34297090,Keeping Watch,kashifire,"sangwoo’s reclined back on his bed, as ali helps gihun build the shoddy barricade, when he once again acknowledges the fact that he’s a horrible, selfish, person. his eyes have been lazily following ali for the past couple minutes, grazing over the sweat beading at the hairline of his thick curly hair as the young man huffs from exertion. his brows are furrowed with concentration, and yet his eyes are still bright with enthusiasm and concern as he ropes together blankets to tie the barricade together. his thick muscles tighten as he lifts the final board in place, and as the job finishes ali and gihun turn to eachother to give an enthusiastic highfive.ali’s too pure to be in this game, sangwoo decides. sangwoo’s only a couple years older than him, and yet ali still seems to carry this childlike innocence and purity that sangwoo can’t help imagine corrupting. sangwoo’s a horrible, selfish, person, and ali knows this— he knew during the honeycomb game that sangwoo lied about not knowing the game, and yet he still places his full trust in him. ali’s strong, dependable, and trusting with every bone in his body. he likes to think that ali’s wrapped around his finger, but he knows deep down, sangwoo would have never made it through without him.sangwoo’s been deceptive to everybody in his life. his mother believes he’s a successful snu graduate, completely unaware of the crippling debt he’s in. he’s constantly pretended to be this kind person he isn’t, and yet ali sees through it all and fully trusts him anyway. sangwoo could tell ali to do anything, and ali would bend over backwards to fulfill his wish.his eyes focus back to ali winding another bedsheet rope to fortify the barricade. sangwoo could tie him up and leave him wrists bound to a post, helpless, and ali would have enduring trust in him to keep him safe. he thinks back to the thrill of when he paid for his bus ticket, how ali’s eyes went wide with astonishment and appreciation at his gift.sangwoo looks up to the tantalizing fortune hanging above their heads. with that kind of money, he could pay off his debts— both of their debts— and have plenty of won to spare. he could give ali more than just a measly bus ride. he could shower him with gifts, anything he could ever want in the world. sangwoo’s a selfish, possessive man, and he wants to see everything ali could possibly give him. he wants to see his wide eyes crinkled with happiness and his face blushing from sangwoo praising him, or his eyes brimming with tears over worry about him. he wants to have ali all to himself, and he can’t stop thinking about what he yearns to do with this man.perhaps sangwoo’s the one wrapped around his finger.ali must’ve noticed his gaze following him, because after working on the barricade, he wipes the sweat off his brow and sits down next to him.“hyung, we finished the barricade. do you think it’ll keep the others out?” ali inquires, completely unaware of sangwoo’s indecent thoughts about him moments before.his eyes look over the finished product, finding it surprisingly sturdy, given the lack of materials available to the two.“it looks great, ali,” he nods, letting a small smile grow on his face. “you did well.”ali grins at that, nodding sheepishly as if slightly overwhelmed by the small amount of praise sangwoo gave him. sangwoo briefly considers continuing, just to see how he’d act when lathered with praise, before wiping the imagery from his mind.they sit there in silence for a couple moments, ali leaning back on the back of the bed as he twiddles his thumbs, occasionally glancing up at sangwoo before catching his gaze and quickly looking away.“is there something you want to say?” sangwoo asks gently. ali looks up from where his eyes settled, an expression of brief shock crossing his face.“ah…” he trails off, before looking at sangwoo again and continuing. “i was going to ask you the same thing,” he mutters, resuming twiddling his thumbs before continuing. “i noticed you were watching us, and i wanted to ask if everything is alright”, he finishes.sangwoo’s briefly taken aback at his perception, and inwardly beats himself up for his obvious leering. “ali, everything’s fine. i’m just worried about everybody tonight,” he says, feigning concern.ali simply nods in return, furrowing his brow and undoubtedly thinking about the chaos that will unfold tonight.“i’m worried too,” he says, after a moment of silence, “but i think we will be alright.”he makes eye contact with sangwoo, holding his gaze as he continues. “after all, we have you to help.”sangwoo lets out a brief chuckle. “have a little more confidence, ali. you can handle those men much better than i could.” he rests his hand on the younger man’s shoulder. “we should go to bed now, our shift is in a couple of hours.”ali nods in agreement, getting up from sangwoo’s bunk before heading towards his own. he crawls under the blanket, before laying on his side and closing his eyes. sangwoo’s thankful he’s turned towards him, leaving him free to study his soft features. despite ali’s anxiety about the group, his face looks almost peaceful as he tries to drift off into sleep. his eyelashes rest softly on his cheeks, his dark eyebrows sitting high on his face as his face relaxes into the pillow. his curly hair ontop his pillow frames his features like a crown, and his plump lips softly part as he starts to fall asleep.sangwoo decides to follow suit, turning away from the man and gazing up at the panels of the bunk above him. if chaos truly breaks out tonight, he’s unsure if all of the group will make it out alive. the old man will be an immediate target, and they won’t have enough ablebodied men able to protect everyone if their barricade collapses. he ignores the voice deep in his conscious that’s eager for more of the competition to be eliminated, and works on lulling himself to sleep before he has to wake up for his shift.he awakens to a dark figure standing over him, and his body reflexively seizes in brief panic.“hyung, it’s me,” he says softly, trying not to awaken anybody else in the quiet room. “it’s time for our shift.” ali finishes, gesturing to the rest of the group sleeping soundly in their bunks.sangwoo relaxes at the sound of his voice, and pulls himself out of bed as he quickly fixes his composure. he and ali head towards the small hole in the barricade, settling themselves in on the floor in preparation for the next three hours.minutes of silence pass by them, before ali speaks in a hushed whisper that sangwoo takes a moment to register.“the next game will be here in the morning,” he says solemnly, keeping his eyes trained outside.sangwoo leans back and tilts his head up, gazing at the moderately filled piggy bank overlooking the group. “are you scared?” sangwoo replies softly, tilting his head to look down at ali. the other man sits there in silence for a couple of minutes, before speaking up again.“yes,” he replies, unmoving. another moment of silence passes before he resumes.“i don’t want to die, and i don’t want us all to die either,” ali continues. at this he looks over to sangwoo, meeting his eyes and holding his gaze as he turns towards him.“i care about the group so much, but…,” he trails off, adverting his eyes briefly before resuming focus at sangwoo, “i care about you the most.”at that, sangwoo’s heart swells, and his mind flashes with brief images of him leaning in right now, caressing his jaw and having the poor man absolutely melt into his grasp. he wants to reassure him, wipe away his tears, give him all the love and affection he could ever deserve. what did sangwoo ever do to deserve this angel caring about him so much? sangwoo isn’t someone to be concerned about, to worry about his safety, and yet ali’s face looks devastated as he thinks about sangwoo’s life ending tomorrow.sangwoo’s so absorbed in his thoughts, it takes him a brief moment to register the threefingered hand reaching out until it’s already resting on top his own.“i don’t know what i would do if i lost you, hyung.” ali finishes, looking down softly at their hands resting on each other as he tightens his grasp and interlocks their fingers, shifting ever the slightest closer towards him.sangwoo’s mind briefly short circuits, registering the warm hand laced between his and oh how this is delightful. sangwoo always thought he’d have to make the first move, but ali exceeded his expectations and is now shyly yet tightly clutching his hand and sangwoo would be damned if he didn’t take full advantage of this opportunity.ali moves to pull his hand away, and before sangwoo has time to think he’s tightening his grasp, keeping the man’s hand within his own as he shifts toward the other and brings his other hand to his shoulder.ali quickly looks away, flitting his gaze around the room before sangwoo moves his hand up towards his chiseled jaw.“look at me,” he murmurs, holding his cheek firmly in his palm. ali’s gaze settles on his eyes, flitting down to his lips briefly in a look that doesn’t escape sangwoo, before flicking his eyes back up to gaze back at him.“i’m not going to lose, and i’m not going to let you lose this either. or the group.” he lets go of ali’s hand, opting to run his fingers up ali’s arm before resting on his muscled bicep.“you’re so capable,” he says lowly, voice still raspy from his sleep, “and strong, and dependable. i could’ve picked anybody for my teammate, and yet i picked you because you’re the only one who i could win with— the only one i wanted to win with.”ali sucks in a breath, gaze frantically flitting from sangwoo’s eyes to his lips to his hand on his arm, facial expression frozen as his plump lips softly exhale a shaky breath from his lungs.“sangwoo, i… i don’t understand,” he breathes out quietly, looking confusedly at sangwoo and yet doing nothing to push sangwoo away from him.sangwoo smiles softly down at him, inwardly rejoicing at ali welcoming his touch, before moving his thumb gently to caress his stubbled jaw.“i care about you, ali.”ali shuddered and closed his eyes, leaning into the touch and softly whimpering. he inched closer to sangwoo until his forehead was resting against sangwoo’s, fluttering his eyes shut as he let himself be held by sangwoo.sangwoo shivered, ali’s tenderness surprising himself. he hasn’t felt an intimate touch like that outside his mother since... he doesn’t know when. he takes this moment of stillness to observe, really observe ali’s facial features. his thick, dark lashes settled against his cheek, and his dark large muscles relaxed in his touch as he breathed softly against sangwoo. ali is too pure and trusting, giving his body to sangwoo like this. ali’s seen the worst of sangwoo, has seen him betray his teammates who trusted him to guide them, and yet ali’s here. trusting him, closing his eyes to sangwoo beingohso close to him, even when sangwoo’s shown time and time again that he’s not one to be trusted.it’s beautiful.he’sbeautiful.sangwoo leans forward, and ali pushes his eyes open to meet sangwoo’s gaze, before closing them gently as sangwoo presses a kiss to his pink lips. ali pauses, letting sangwoo hold his lips against his, before tentatively reciprocating, pushing back with enthusiasm and it's everything sangwoo ever thought it would be. here, right now, ali’s allhis, and sangwoo will take as much as ali’s willing to give him. ali’s kissing him back, all want and need, and sangwoo’s almost surprised at the pure desperation he’s showing him. sangwoo grips him closer, pulling ali almost into his lap as he finally gets to run his fingers through the thick, dark curls resting atop his head. ali hums in agreement, letting out sweet soft sighs as sangwoo grips his hair tighter.sangwoo’s eyes grow dark as he imagines gripping ali’s strong, thick wrists and holding them behind his back, pushing him against the wall and ravaging the man until he can barely see straight. he wants to make ali a needy mess, have him begging for sangwoo, and leave his now pink cheeks damp with tears and panting from exertion. ali would be so patient, so trusting, letting sangwoo do anything he wanted to him, even as he writhes with overstimulation or shudders from the pleasure. sangwoo can’t help but yearn to see his body, tanned and muscled, images flashing through his mind of sangwoo on top of him, crowding his body as he pants and keens from need. he imagines pressing ali’s skin against his own, rutting the tent in his pants against ali’s as he beckons for the younger man to take sangwoo’s boxers off. sangwoo knows how enthusiastically he’d do it, whimpering to himself as he sees sangwoo’s sizeable length. he’d go in with his hand, first, or maybe he’d have enough courage to take him into his mouth, wrapping those plump, perfect lips around his girth and—a crashing noise across the room startles them out of their liplocked embrace, and ali jolts his head towards the noise as sangwoo guides him off his lap, inwardly sighing at the new loss of friction against his growing erection. the room is too dark to see any movement, and ali and sangwoo let a wave of silence fall over them as they look out intently for any figures lurking in the shadows.after waiting for close to ten minutes, the room remaining dead silent the entire time, sangwoo officially declares it a false alarm and sits back down on the floor, ali quickly falling suit. although the mood from before is gone, extinguished by the remembrance of where they were and why they were there, ali still sits far closer to the other man than he would’ve dared to before.sangwoo sees this and smiles at him, sliding his hand on top of ali’s as his face brightens from the casual intimacy.“we will make it through the next game— we all will,” sangwoo murmurs next to his ear, echoing his reassurances from earlier.ali nods to himself before poorly stifling a yawn, undoubtedly due to the late night they’ve both had.sangwoo checks his watch, noticing with a grimace that they’ve been up almost thirty minutes past when their shift was supposed to end.“ali,” he says, calling his attention as the other man looks up at him. “our shift is over, we should head to bed now.”ali nods silently in return, following suit when sangwoo rises to his feet.“here, i’ll go wake up saebyok,” sangwoo says, before adding “you should get your rest before the next game, ali.”they walk together until sangwoo parts ways, heading towards saebyok’s bunk, and ali trods on alone, feeling around in the dark until he’s successfully located his bed. he lays down, looking up into the darkness and unable to sleep, until he hears the sounds of sangwoo settling into his own bunk besides him.“goodnight, hyung,” he calls out in a hushed voice, awaiting a response. he hears the cot’s sheets rustling as sangwoo turns towards him.“goodnight ali,” he replies softly, gently smiling down at him before closing his eyes and trying to fall asleep.ali quickly follows suit, knowing that he has to sleep well if he wants him— or sangwoo— to survive the next game. he thinks absentmindedly back to their earlier  kissing, running his fingers softly over his lips as he reminisces on what it felt like kissing the man he’s admired since his arrival at this place. ali quietly promises that he’ll do as much as he can to get through the game, doing everything sangwoo wants of him so they could make it out with the rest of the group alive. he feels his body grow heavy as sleep lulls his consciousness to sleep, welcoming the darkness as he tries to forget the game that’s putting their lives at risk tomorrow."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34406347,Player 456 Eliminated,startlingirony,"gihun laid on the ground, his limbs strewn about. the man was barely conscious, eyelids trembling as he tried desperately to keep his eyes open. without lifting his head he looked to the players standing above him. saebyeok’s face was contorted in a pained expression, and sangwoo clutched at his bleeding cheek.the glass bridge from the fifth game had shattered behind them, throwing jagged shards and chunks of debris at them. gihun, being the last to climb across the dark and seemingly unending pit behind them, took the most of the blow, even making an effort to shuffle aside. this awkward fumble had cost him, he’d somewhat shielded the other two.there were several significant shards of glass jutting out of gihun’s stomach and torso. amongst the ret dots where smaller pieces had made contact with his skin, there were three deeper wounds. one, a longer glass piece that had speared gihun under his belly button, another, a thicker piece stuck deep within the skin just left of his sternum. the worrisome one was a shard that struck centimeters away from his heart.gihun gave a pained and shallow breath, one of his hands slowly reaching up to grab at his abdomen. with every inhale and exhale the glass that pierced him sent waves of pain through him, despite the constant screaming of his nerves that something was wrong, something was going terribly wrong.he went to try and remove the piece beside his heart, but a hand quickly stopped him. gihun was able to visualize sangwoo’s face through the haze.“hyung,hyung,don’t,” he began, kneeling aside gihun on the floor. “let me do it. if you hit an artery, you’ll surely die. please allow me.” if gihun knew one thing about sangwoo, it was that sangwoo was unfortunately skilled in the practice of bottling emotions. externally, the younger man was stern, unfeeling, but gihun knew inside his chest his heart was hammering away like it would explode at any given moment.gihun could only nod, mouth agape as sangwoo gently took hold of one of the shards. he felt the shard move slightly, and before he could even cry out, saebyeok was shoving a ripped piece of her shirt into his mouth.“bite down,” she said simply.the shards were removed as quickly as sangwoo could muster, he knew it was best to just rip off the bandaid quickly. each removal resulted in an echoing, anguished cry that ripped itself from gihun’s throat unconsciously.his pain was far from over, the damage had been done, but god, it was so much better with the glass taken out. it had been poking and prodding at him, still doing more damage as it remained inside.gihun’s vision was getting more blurry, it felt like there was cotton in his nowringing ears. he was about to faint. he wasn’t unfamiliar with the feeling, he’d had blood work done before. but this wasn't blood work. this was squid game and this was cho sangwoo and this was kang saebyeok. he wasn’t in some little clinic wondering if the girl he’d had a one night stand with had given him hiv, he was on the floor covered in glass and his own blood. he coughed. something came up and by the reactions of the two above him, gihun guessed it was blood.“don’t go to sleep, hyung! don’t close your eyes!” sangwoo called, patting gihun’s cheek. there was something in his voice gihun had never heard before, something he couldn’t exactly place in his distressed stage and muggled mind. it was like being given a flavored soda, and knowing the soda, but having no clue what flavor it was. cherry? strawberry? that purple mixture of chemicals labelled as grape, that doesn’t actually taste like grape?gihun’s lips were going white. “can’t… help it,” he muttered before his eyes rolled back and he involuntarily lost consciousness. he sagged back onto the floor, body unmoving and completely limp.gihun was surprised he woke up. he wasn’tsupposedto wake up. when his eyes closed last he’d silently resigned himself to death, he knew this was it. but, dear god, here he was.his eyes slowly opened, his breathing shallow and raspy. it still felt like there was something heavy in his lungs, something foreign and unwelcome. he could barely see anything, only swirling shapes and the little bit of light that was in the room. room… he must have been taken back to the dormitory room.the man simply laid, sitting like a computer that was taking a long while to turn on. the hypothetical cotton was taken from his ears, and he heard some voices. it took a few moments for the words to start processing, but gihun was able to label sangwoo and saebyeok’s hushed muttering.“so what do we do with him?” sangwoo offered, sounding artificially calm.“we can’t just kill him,” saebyeok replied, a morsel of panic in her voice.sangwoo gave a sigh. “i wouldn’t be able to anyways,” he admitted dejectedly.“what makes him special? i mean, ali” saebyeok started.sangwoo quickly cut her off. “he’sdifferent.he’s from before the games. before everything. how am i supposed to kill someone that came to my birthday parties, who copied off my tests in school, who gave me his jacket when it was cold despite his cheeks being bright red?” he was ranting now, and gihun’s eyes were wide open as he listened.saebyeok gave a pause before speaking again. “he did mention you two were childhood friends,” she offered in an attempt to console the nowupset sangwoo. she sounded slightly on edge, most likely thinking sangwoo a threat and also not knowing how to console someone she met less than a week ago.“i remember the day he suddenly showed up at school. first grade, this scrawny kid with scraped knees and a brandnew shirt comes in and sits next to me. says his name is gihun, smiles at me. he said he’d just moved from outside incheon. he offered to share his eight pack of crayons with me, even though i’d just gotten the sixtyfour pack,” sangwoo remembered.gihun remembered that day. his mom had saved up for that new shirt, it was blue and white and made with cotton, he’d stained it later that day on the playground. a few of the kids had drawn up a squid game in the courtyard at recess. it had rained recently, and the courtyard was muddy, so he came home with a dirty shirt and a big smile. he’d won the game that day.gihun and sangwoo had struggled to become friends at first. gihun would rather play outside and get dirty and run around, while sangwoo would rather sit with a 5th grade level book or draw a picture. sangwoo always wore these nicer polo shirts, so he was hesitant to do anything that would get it dirty. he didn’t want to cause more trouble to his mother during washing, he was a good and considerate child.but he was also considerate towards gihun. sometimes on the last day before his mother was paid, gihun would come to school with only a small bag of crackers and maybe a fruit. so, sangwoo would ask his mother for an extra cookie or sometimes even another sandwich just so gihun could eat.“he would always have the biggest smile when i would give him that sandwich,” sangwoo explained, hands in his lap thumbing the bottom of his jacket. “he was always too skinny. it always worried me, my mother too. she would always give him an extra serving of food when he came over for dinner.”there was a long, quiet pause. the only sounds really present in the room were the ambient creakings and groanings of the building, and the shallow sounds of breathing.“i’ll go check on him,” saebyeok offered, rising to her feet.the room had been cleared of the bunk beds, and only three remained; one for each of them. the two of them had been sitting on sangwoo’s bed off to the side, and saebyeok approached gihun’s bed in the middle. gihun promptly shut his eyes to pretend he hadn’t heard the previous conversation.saebyeok approached, bending down beside the bed. she squinted, and then she smacked his cheek with medium power.gihun’s eyes flew open. he let out a weird sound, sort of like aguh!but not very loud.“so you were awake.”gihun slowly pushed himself up by his elbows, suddenly aware of the wounds present in his torso. he grimaced as he continued to push up. he was bandaged, to his right on the floor was a somewhat shredded bedsheet that had been used. the fabric he’d been wrapped with was still soaked through nonetheless, and sitting up only darkened the stains on the wrappings.sangwoo had heard saebyeok, and he was instantly by gihun’s side. “don’t sit up, stay laying down, don’t hurt yourself” he insisted.“i’m going to die anyways,” gihun snapped, frustration and exhaustion from the constant pain coming to the surface. he winced again as he finally sat himself up, leaning against the steel bedframe. it wasn’t at all comfortable. “look how much blood i’ve lost, sangwoo. i’m still bleeding out and i’m sure something is punctured.”speaking was becoming difficult, something was definitely wrong with one of his lungs. the glass that stabbed him near his heart had most likely damaged it, and maybe even his ribcage. something was definitely awry in that area.“saebyeok, could you give us a moment please,” sangwoo asked, a drop of venom in his voice. she nodded, understanding he was not mad at her, and shuffled away to her own bed. she was injured too, after all. she needed a little bit of rest herself.“i’m sorry,” gihun said.“shut up,” sangwoo replied. “we’re getting you out of here.”“there’s not much you can do,” gihun stubbornly mumbled. “it’s best you survive anyways.”“and why does your life matter less?” sangwoo questioned, giving him that stern look he’d been giving him since before the first game. behind his firmly knitted eyebrows and pressed lips were the eyes of a man at the brink of… something. gihun couldn’t read it.“you have a reputation,” gihun began, stopping to take shallow and wheezy breaths. “you were the smartest, brightest boy out of all of us. your mother still talks about you. me? i’m millions of won in debt, gambling or smoking it all away while my mother’s feet are swollen purple and my daughter sits waiting for me. i’m just a slave to my own bad habits, sangwoo. i’m not much compared to you.”sangwoo only took a second before answering. “why do you always do that? why do you always compare yourself to me like i’m so much better?” he shouted, loud enough that saebyeok turned to look.“because you are, sangwoo!” gihun shouted as loud as he could muster.sangwoo had fury in his eyes. “just because i’m good at things doesn’t mean you’re to be tossed out like weekly garbage!” he stopped, he had that sore feeling in his nose you sometimes get before crying, his throat was tight. “i never… thought myself better than you.”gihun’s eyebrows relaxed, he didn’t even know they had tensed. he didn’t say anything, just trying to keep himself breathing.“i liked you. i liked you a lot. the reason i wasn’t happy with you, the reason i didn’t want to talk to you when i saw you were here was because i didn’t want to believe you’d fallen into the same shithole as me,” sangwoo admitted. “after high school, after we stopped talking, i would think about you sometimes hoping you were doing well, that your mother was okay, that you were okay. seeing you here proved all my well wishes hadn’t worked.”sangwoo was looking down now, his hands clenching the bedsheets tightly as he sat on his knees beside the bed on the floor. gihun simply sat, eyes wide and mouth slightly agape, taking in what had been said.“i was disappointed to see you here too,” gihun stated.sangwoo looked up. “you wouldn’t be the first to be disappointed in me.”“everyone looked up to you. every mother of every kid in the neighborhood spoke highly of you, everyone wanted you to be their study partner. you were the brightest light amongst some bright lights. i was so proud to be your friend,” gihun recalled, smiling now. “i remember telling everyone i was friends with cho sangwoo.” he had a slightly dreamy, slightly dazed look on his face.the edges of sangwoo’s lips turned up for a second. “you act like you weren’t a good friend, you were selfless. you would always give me your last pencil, your last tissue, you even gave me your favorite shirt,” he said quietly, not wanting saebyeok to hear. in reality, sangwoo had sat and cried whenever he stained that shirt, or ripped it. the day he finally outgrew the shirt, he sat and cried for a good hour. he couldn’t even get his arms into the sleeves, so he sat there with it around his neck while he cried.gihun couldn’t help but laugh, his smile turning sour as the pain hit him again, and he was pulled from memory lane back down to hell. he realized he was running out of time, he was still bleeding and his clothes were soaked.it’s like sangwoo could read him like an open book. his lips pursed again, and he shakily brought one of his hands up to gihun’s. gihun’s hands were nearly ice cold, the skin paling as sangwoo took one of gihun’s hands into his.“don’t think about it,” sangwoo whispered.“i’m cold, sangah,” gihun said, his hand weakly squeezing sangwoo’s.“are you scared?” sangwoo asked, scooting closer. gihun hadn’t called himsangahin at least two decades. it was what gihun called him affectionately, in a littlebrother kind of way. it was only used when they were alone, when gihun was feeling sweet.“i know you don’t like me anymore, sangah, but please hold me,” gihun pleaded. “if i’m going to die, i don’t want to be alone.”sangwoo got up, slowly sitting next to him on the bed. the sheets were stained dark crimson, but sangwoo would fulfill his friend’s last wish. he slowly laid down aside gihun, pulling the blanket up to cover him and keep him warm.“i never said i didn’t like you anymore,” sangwoo said, avoiding gihun’s eyes.“mmm, you like me?” gihun replied, smiling again. he had scooted down so he was lying on his side, him and sangwoo facing each other.sangwoo paused. “it goes without saying. do you think i would be letting you bleed all over me if i didn’t?” he joked.gihun squeezed his hand. “believe me, i wish we were in better circumstances,” he replied.a beat of silence passed. it wasn’t uncomfortable, just the two of them treasuring this moment knowing what was coming.“i had a crush on you for years, sangah,” gihun suddenly blurted out.sangwoo froze. “i’m sorry, what?”“i had a crush on you. in high school… you were staying over, you’d fallen asleep next to me on the couch, and all i wanted to do in that moment was take your hand, put a blanket on you, and fall asleep with my head on your shoulder,” gihun admitted, his cheeks tinting despite the blood loss. “you’d become so associated with safety, so i clung to that.”“why didn’t you tell me?” sangwoo asked, eyes wide and voice concerned.“i was worried you’d run away, call me a freak and tell everyone that seong gihun is a fairy,” gihun said with a sigh. “you didn’t look the accepting type.”“if you had kissed me, i wouldn’t have minded, you know,” sangwoo quietly whispered. this, saebyeok just could not hear.gihun looked him straight in the eyes, a smile appearing on his lips. “can i kiss you now?”sangwoo, without thinking, leaned down and pulled gihun closer. “yes,” he stated firmly. he wasn’t smiling, but his eyes were.gihun beamed and leaned forward, slowly pressing his lips against sangwoo’s. having been married, he knew what he was doing. he took both of sangwoo’s hands into his as they kissed.sangwoo was having a crisis. when he saw gihun again during the first game, he remembered something. not a memory, but a feeling. he’d remembered his feelings for gihun. it was as if a car had been started for the first time in years, sitting idle. but kissing him? that was driving that same car down the highway at 83 miles per hour at three in the morning with music blasting and the windows down. kissing gihun was as satisfying as catching a radio station playing a favorite song, as satisfying as the first steps into the ocean on a hot day at the beach.but it was bittersweet. sangwoo could taste gihun’s blood. it reminded him that gihun was literally dying with each moment that went on. he wished they hadn’t stopped talking after high school, that they had stayed friends and that these confessions hadn’t had to wait until gihun’s literal deathbed. they’d lost possible years together.but gihun was smiling when their lips parted.“when i heard that you’d gotten married, i had to go and get drunk for two weeks just to deal with it,” sangwoo confessed. there was no reason to keep secrets now, they would die with gihun.“i’m sorry,” gihun said, pouting slightly. he brought a hand to sangwoo’s cheek, flinching very slightly at the stubble sangwoo had grown. his eyes swept over sangwoo. “you aged pretty well, you know. it’s annoying that you stayed hot.”sangwoo couldn’t resist the snicker that burst out of him. “you’re not hard to look at either,” he joked, despite being serious. “the hair looks nice.”gihun smiled and pressed a brief kiss to his forehead. “thank you,” he muttered breathily. “i’m kind of tired, will you stay with me as i fall asleep?”sangwoo nodded. he felt his heart drop, thethunk!was almost audible. “yes, go ahead,” he whispered.gihun’s eyes slowly slid closed. “thank you, sangah. i love you,” he said gently. his hands still clasped sangwoo’s.sangwoo paused for a moment, taking in those words. “i love you too, gihunnie hyung,” he replied.sangwoo was woken up by the usual music that woke the players in the morning. his eyelids felt heavy, but he still made the effort to open his eyes. “gihun, are you”gihun was ice cold. sangwoo had still been holding him when he woke up.“gihun?” sangwoo called, sitting up now. his eyes were wide, his heartbeat was beginning to quicken. “gihun!”gihun wasn’t responding. sangwoo checked his pulse on his neck. there was no pulse. just gihun, lying dead and cold.sangwoo crumpled, his stern facade breaking into tiny pieces. he began trembling, hot tears quickly forming in his eyes and spilling over onto his cheeks. the man held gihun so close, beginning to wail and sob in pure agony. his childhood best friend and then man who had just unlocked his heart once again, now lay peacefully under him on the bed.sangwoo thought he looked like an angel, lying there like nothing was going wrong in the world, like he hadn’t just died in a moneymurder game.player 456, eliminated."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34139971,blow on it like it's hot,redmaynes,"sangwoo clutched his left cheek; his teeth were aching after the handsome, yet unprepossessing businessman clocked him with a surprisingly strong slap.“i didn’t think that was what you meant when you wagered with me, sir,” he said stiffly, straightening up to match the confident posture of the other man despite being humbled in a stupidchildren’s game.“oh?” the man’s eyebrow quirked up, which was almost as infuriating as seeing his ingratiating slight smirk. “what did you have in mind?”sangwoo ignored the question to replace it with his own. “what’s your aim here? just to flash stacks ofwonin my face to have an excuse to slap me around? who do you work for?”the man tilted his head. “the real question is if you’re interested in working towards a great opportunity to pay off the outstanding debt that you’re in.”“how did you kn”“you’re currently being pursued by the police on charges of fraud, embezzlement, forgery, and other unmentionables that you wouldn’t want your mom, or your colleagues, to know about. how long will you keep running away from your problem before you get caught in your lies for good?”“i’m managing it right now,” sangwoo spits out, yanking at his cuffs to straighten them out.“you’ve been hopping from hotel to hotel under fake names, all the while still subsisting off the money you’ve stolen from your clients. and when that money runs out, what will you do then?”sangwoo’s jaw tensed.“you don’t have any assets to save you, or your mother’s, for that matter. i don’t suppose you have a father to rely on...”no sooner did the word “father” slip out of the mans’ mouth did sangwoo lunge for his neck, but the other calmly stepped away as sangwoo clutched at his shirt collar.“you bastard,” sangwoo rasped, eye to eye with the everunshakable gaze of the other man.“i seem to have hit a nerve.”sangwoo shook him once, twice. “give me a reason right now not to beat you into a bloody pulp for disrespecting me from the moment you laid eyes on me.”the man regarded him keenly. “because i have the power to take you somewhere to erase the life that you have now.”“impossible.”“you haven’t been able to shake law enforcement off your tail in the past year, nor any of your debts. if you’ve had an option to run, you’d already take it. you’ve humored me enough... why not stay a little longer? surely you don’t have anywhere else to go.”sangwoo stared him down as the adrenaline from gearing up for a nasty fight ebbed away, leaving him with only grim realization.his hands dropped to his sides. “what do you want from me. sir.”the man fixed his rumpled collar and gave sangwoo a small smile.“no need for such stiff formalities. i’m offering a simple business transaction. a service in exchange for payment. if you’re uncomfortable with corporeal punishment, another alternative can be discussed.”sangwoo stared at him.the salesman dropped his gaze down pointedly, and looked up again.sangwoo’s mouth set itself into a thinner line. “how much would i get?”∆“you know,” the man groaned, gripping the back of sangwoo’s head, “you should do this for a living.”sangwoo swallowed around him in response, ripping out another guttural moan from the man with the thickest cock he’s had in a while. the subway hall was strangely bare, as if it expected a need for sangwoo to have some privacy as he got on his knees so easily for the promise of thick stacks of money.“you seem like you’ve done this many times before; even my past girlfriends have never been able to suck cock like you,” he panted, fingers curling in sangwoo’s hair to drag him up and down his shaft rhythmically. “you wouldn’t be in debt if you whored yourself out more, did you ever think of that?”sangwoo gagged as the man shoved himself back inside his mouth and hit the back of his throat, and he scrabbled at his thighs to push himself off.“can i earn my money without having to hear you talk like you’re in a bad porno?” he glared at the smug face above him, wiping the spit dripping down the corners of his mouth with a thumb. he had to tuck his glasses into his blazer’s inside pocket because they were fogging up so badly and slipping down his face. it was a force of habit to keep them on; the last man he fucked liked to see him wear them when sangwoo was getting his ass reamed six ways to sunday.the man smirked. “what pornos are you watching?” he took his dick in hand, slapped the length of it over sangwoo’s stubbled cheek, smearing precum on his cheekbone before slipping it inside the hot wet inside of sangwoo’s mouth.sangwoo made a noise in the back of his throat at the intrusion, but stretched his mouth to accommodate. he breathed in a labored breath through his nostrils and bobbed his head, closing his eyes as he settled into a rhythm that made the weight on his tongue manageable.his fingers twitched towards the bulge in his slacks ruined at the knees, probably, by kneeling on the dirty subway floor and squeezed, moaning at the sensation but rutting up into the muted touch as he continued sucking cock like he had something to prove. something to earn.“mmm,” the man purred, and sangwoo hazily realized that he never even got a name to call him by. he’s just yet another anonymous to add to the list of nameless faces that sangwoo has shamelessly opened his needy mouth and spread his legs for, in grimy bathroom stalls and seedy hotel rooms. “suck on the head for me.”he almost immediately complied, swallowing around the man’s entire length before pulling back to just gently suckle on the cockhead. his eyes fluttered halfclosed. this was one of his favorite parts of sucking dick, when he could lick and suck on the most sensitive part, his lips stretching obscenely around the head.maybe his health would be just a bit better if he stopped using cigarettes to fix his oral fixation and started giving blowjobs again instead.“god,” the man groaned as sangwoo reached to cup and fondle his balls while continuing his ministrations. “you were made for this.”his cheeks flushed hearing the praise, and he hummed in agreement before bobbing his head even faster, not caring about the mess he’s making with his drool soaking the front of the man’s pants and his own hands. he winced as the man gripped his hair again to guide him roughly up and down his cock, completely using sangwoo’s mouth as a cocksleeve to jerk himself off.the faster the man thrust the more desperately sangwoo sucked, even when tears pooled in his eyes and threatened to spill over the edge of his cheeks as he frantically rubbed his clothed dick off with a firm palm it’s not like not cumming in his pants is going to salvage them any much more.he jerked when the man kicked away his hand to replace it with an oxfordclad foot. he pressed down.sangwoo whimpered, very loudly.“get yourself off like this,” the man roughly said, laughing softly when sangwoo obediently thrust up into the touch, like a pathetic dog in heat desperate to hump anything in the thick of arousal.the blowjob is absolutely sloppy at this point: sangwoo’s lower half of his face is drenched in saliva, tears, and precum, and he’s moaning brokenly as his mouth continued to be abused in the best way possible. the man gripped the base of his cock, and with his free hand he grabbed sangwoo's hair to forcefully press his swollen lips to the beautiful, uncut cockhead in a perverted kiss. almost as quickly as he pulled sangwoo forward, the man yanked his head back to release sangwoo's mouth with a pop only to guide himself back into sangwoo's mouth.“fuck, i’m gonna come on your face,” the man grunted, fisting his cock and slapping the head on sangwoo’s reddened, spitslick lips before aiming at his cheek.sangwoo closed his eyes on instinct and shuddered as the first string of warm cum hit his face, and squirmed against the man’s shoe still pressing down on his cock until he shook with the orgasm that hit him suddenly like the slap he took from the man.he sucked in huge gulps of air, eyes still closed as the man finished painting his face with warm cum, and spread it across his cheeks, lips, chin with his cock.“suck.” sangwoo peeked out of one eye that wasn’t entirely streaked with semen and opened his mouth to suckle the remnants of pearly cum still on the man’s cock.he blew out a breathy, low moan as sangwoo continued licking at the twitching, sensitive skin, and fit as much of the man's cock in his mouth as he continued suckling, whining in protest as the man tried to take a step back too sensitive, probably. but sangwoo wasn't going to let him leave before he at least got the most fun out of servicing the cock that he would probably kill to have ruined his slutty little hole.the man let sangwoo tongue at his foreskin and the soft, wet and red cockhead beneath it before pulling away and returning his other foot to the ground as he briskly tucked himself in.“congratulations,” he drawled, zipping up his slacks and discreetly wiping away stray droplets of...somethingnear his crotch. “you’ve earned your pay. you’re allowed to take that suitcase and make do with it however you wish.”sangwoo didn’t quite feel like a winner just yet, as he was still carefully wiping cum out of his eyelashes to make sure that he wasn’t going to accidentally give himself an eye irritation. he contemplated the liquid on his hand for a second before bringing it to his mouth and lapping it up. the man arched a brow, and smirked.“hungry?”“shut up,” sangwoo replied easily, taking a handkerchief out of his breast pocket to wipe away the remaining wetness on his face.“you can use a couple of bills from that ten millionwonto go to a vending machine and get yourself a more substantial snack.”“you’re even more insufferable after you’ve come. how is that possible? i thought you’d forget how to speak for a bit.”the man’s lips quirked up. “try harder next time.”sangwoo rolled his eyes and turned to him to retort, but the moment he turned around, there was no one beside him.sangwoo’s brow furrowed, but he shrugged to himself and sighed, picking the suitcase with the funny little brown card sticking out of it off the ground and laying it flat on his lap: partly so that he has it in his sight, mostly because people are probably going to see the cum stains on his pants as he waited for the next train to arrive.shit."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34298500,You Don't Know How Long You Have Tonight (And I'm Scared Cause I Loved You),,"gihun knew his body didn't feel the same, groggy and hot. he assumed it was a fever at first, but he soon realized what his symptoms really were. when he woke up from his slumber, he could feel the slick slipping from his hole. it wet his pants and made his thighs slippery. he whimpered and shifted his body. why now? gihun hadn't had a heat in a long time and it had to come in such a dangerous moment.gihun didn't know what to do.he was vulnerable. if any alphas caught a whiff of his scent, it could lead to something terrible happening. gihun shivered at the idea of deoksu or any of his minions finding out about his heat.""gihun?""gihun snapped out of his thoughts and shifted his gaze, his eyes meeting sangwoo's. sangwoo stared down at him, sitting beside the omega.""you got your heat?"" sangwoo said, fingertips brushing against gihun's cheek. gihun fought the urge to lean into the touch, something his inner omega pleaded for.gihun nodded, ""yeah, i'm fine though. it's not as bad when you get older,""sangwoo didn't seem pacified, staring at gihun with an expression the omega couldn't decipher.""your smell is still strong, gihun,"" sangwoo spoke, ""if any of the alphas here smell you, they'll try to take advantage of you,""gihun let out a dry laugh, ""who would want an old omega like me""sangwoo lowered himself further down. his face was a mere inch away from gihun's. the omega froze, staring into the alpha's eyes. sangwoo inhaled deeply, eyes closed as he took in gihun's scent. gihun felt his body warm. another glob of slick rushing out from his hole. there was something about having an alpha smell him so closely that made his instincts go wild.""uh... sangwoo?""""you smell so good, gihun,"" sangwoo spoke, ""anyone would want you,""gihun was stunned.the look sangwoo was giving him, the way the alpha's scent grew. gihun couldn't believe it, was he implying...""sangwoo, what are you trying to say?""sangwoo moved his face closer, nose brushing against gihun's. gihun looked away and closed his eyes. the omega whimpered, sangwoo's scent was growing more prominent and heating him up. sangwoo gripped his face gently and forced the omega to look at him.""gihun, let me help you,"" sangwoo spoke, ""let me breed you,""gihun's inner omega preened, seemingly ready to bend over and take it from sangwoo. however, gihun shook his head, nose gently bumping into sangwoo's own nose.""you don't have to, i'll be fine, sangwoo,""the alpha above him growled, moving his face into gihun's neck and scenting him. the omega bucked his hips up and whined.""i don't have to, gihun,"" sangwoo whispered, ""i want to,""gihun didn't say a word.""you'll lose the next game if you stay like this,"" sangwoo continued, ""will you be a good omega and let me help you?""gihun felt so hot. his mind screaming at him to say yes, to take the offer he had wanted for years. gihun hesitantly nodded.""do you really want it?"" sangwoo asked, ""use your words,""gihun gulped, ""yes... i want it,""sangwoo pulled away, standing to his feet. gihun looked up at him in confusion.""we can't do it here, we'll wake everyone up,"" sangwoo said, ""we should go to the restroom,""gihun nodded. sangwoo pulled him up from his reclined position, the omega's legs wobbling. gihun winced at the feeling of his slick trailing down his legs. sangwoo woke saebyeok, whispering something to her. she nodded, ready to take watch. gihun could see her concerned glance held within her stoic expression. gihun gave the female alpha a reassuring smile, but it didn't seem to do much. saebyeok moved to wake jiyeong, to have a partner to keep watch with her.after members of the night watch were set, sangwoo led gihun to the door. he kept a firm grip on the omega, keeping him steady. sangwoo knocked on the door. a masked figure appeared, staring silently at the duo.""he has his heat,"" sangwoo stated, the masked figure silently opened the door soon after.sangwoo kept his grasp firm on gihun, pulling him close and away from the guard. sangwoo kept his eye on the guard and gihun figured out why. gihun could smell the faint alpha pheromones coming from the guard. he turned away from the masked guard, trying to ignore the scent and focusing on sangwoo's. his scent grounded gihun as much as it also drove him wild.eventually, they entered the restroom. sangwoo yanked the omega into a stall and locked it behind them. gihun stood there, unsure. when the alpha turned to face him, gihun looked down at the ground. he still felt as if he were forcing his sangwoo to mate with him, an omega past his prime.""well?"" sangwoo said.""maybe, we shouldn't do this,"" gihun spoke, ""i mean, i'll be fine""sangwoo moved forward, causing gihun to step back until the back of his legs brushed against the toilet. sangwoo's scent was overwhelming, forcing its way up his nose and encouraging his slick to continue to leak out shamefully. his legs buckled and he involuntarily sat down on the toilet seat, staring up at sangwoo. the alpha seemed so much larger when he stood above him like this.""gihun."" the omega flinched at sangwoo's tone, ""do you want to die tomorrow?""gihun shook his head.""you'll die if i don't help you, gihun,""despite the harsh phrasing, gihun knew it was true. he would be too weak tomorrow if he wasn't fucked beforehand. gihun was an older omega, he didn't need to have as much sex, once would be enough to fix it.his focus shifted as hands gently traced his neck. gihun closed his eyes and hummed contently. the hands dipped down into his shirt, tracing his collarbones. gihun's breath hitched as the hands were removed, only to slide up the bottom of his shirt. his chest was exposed and nipples traced. the warmth of sangwoo's hands felt so good, especially as they prodded and tugged at his nipples. the hands stopped for a moment, still in place.""i'll ask you one last time."" sangwoo said, ""do you want me to fuck you?""gihun decided it was too far gone and nodded.""take off your pants then, omega,""gihun nodded once again. he was hesitant as he kicked off his shoes and pants. gihun wasn't a typically feminine or petite omega. he didn't find himself to be as pretty or special. as if sangwoo could read his thoughts, the alpha spoke.""hey, stop overthinking. focus on me,""sangwoo tugged off his own pants, causing gihun to glance at the alpha's length. it wasn't too large, but it was the perfect size for gihun. he stared back up to meet sangwoo's gaze, who had seemed to notice the subject of gihun's focus.""bend over,"" sangwoo ordered.gihun stood up and slowly bent over, hands placed on the wall behind the toilet and revealing his slick covered hole to sangwoo. he couldn't believe it still. this was something he always tried to push back into his recesses of his mind. he never acted on his urges, never once made a move on his childhood friend. gihun never could be the omega that he thought sangwoo deserved. sangwoo was meant for greater things, greater people. but, even as other alphas helped him through his heats, his thoughts always came back to sangwoo.""i'm going to push in, gihun.""he felt as sangwoo pressed against his hole. the tip pushed through and gihun couldn't help the needy moan that sounded from his mouth. inch by inch, the alpha filled him with everything he needed. gihun had forgotten how pleasurable and hot an alpha could be inside him. it had been a long time since the last time he had had sex.""fuck..."" sangwoo muttered behind him, finally filling the omega completely.gihun wiggled his hips a little, ""need more, sangwoo,""the omega knew he was losing his mind, caught in the pleasure and the urge to be bred and used. his hole needed sangwoo, it needed his alpha.""please,"" gihun said, turning his head to look back at sangwoo. the alpha looked flustered, cheeks dusted red. gihun's eyes widened at the sight. he was making sangwoo like that? he could feel the slick leak out and continue to lube up his alpha's length. it covered the alpha generously. gihun would have felt embarrassed if he wasn't focused on sangwoo's expression.normally, the alpha was composed and logical, but seeing him like this only added to gihun's pleasure.sangwoo pulled back out slowly, making gihun turn his head back forward and whine. then, sangwoo suddenly snapped his hips forward, causing gihun to loudly moan. sangwoo picked up the pace, thrusting in and out of the omega roughly.""ah, sangwoo!"" gihun moaned. his legs wobbled, but sangwoo secured his hands on his hips. he held gihun up as he filled him with this throbbing length.""i've wanted this for so long,"" sangwoo spoke, causing gihun to turn to face him again. ""i've wanted to breed you for years,""gihun whined, strands of his hair sticking to his face face due to his sweat. sangwoo had wanted him too?""i've wanted to claim you ever since you presented."" sangwoo slammed his hips into gihun, quickening his pace.sangwoo leaned over him, pressing his nose into gihun's neck as he continued his brutal pace. gihun moaned, his senses in overdrive. each thrust brushed against his prostate, each groan near his ear made him forget everything. he forgot about the games and his debt; he could ignore the pain and the death around him for once. it was just him and his alpha.""fuck,"" sangwoo growled, digging his nails in gihun's hips, ""you're such a good omega, taking me so well,""a feeling of pride filled gihun's chest.he was making his alpha happy, he was being good.""good for alpha,"" was all gihun could say between his moans and pants.""so good,"" sangwoo repeated, ""you're mine, all mine,""""all yours,"" gihun confirmed.that seemed to spark something within sangwoo, making him stop scenting gihun and pull himself off the omega. before gihun could speak, he was caught off with the roughest thrust yet. his moans filled the restroom stall as sangwoo shaped his insides. it felt right, as if it always and only should had been sangwoo shoving his length inside of him. gihun practically screamed when sangwoo started to rub his length, it previously untouched and neglected between the omega's legs.""alpha!"" gihun screamed, ""alpha, please, fill me,""sangwoo grunted, timing his strokes on gihun's length with his thrusts.the omega whined, body shaking and mind hazy from pleasure.""i'm going to knot you, going to fill you with my seed,"" sangwoo growled. ""gonna make you mine,""gihun came, ropes of white covering sangwoo's hand. he quickly became overstimulated as sangwoo continued without a pause. gihun glanced back at sangwoo once again. he watched at how focused the alpha seemed. he stared down at the omega with a possessive gaze, causing gihun to shiver in pleasure. even just with that stare, he felt claimed by the alpha. he felt like he was sangwoo's.""mine... my omega,"" sangwoo said, ""so pretty,""a deep whine sounded from gihun's throat.gihun could feel how sangwoo's knot was developing, catching on the rim of his hole. his alpha would soon fill him with his hot seed, coat and claim his insides. it would lock them together in the way he had been imagining for years.""knot me,"" gihun cried out, ""make me yours,""sangwoo pushed his knot past gihun's rim one last time, ejaculating into the warm heat of the omega's slick hole. sangwoo fought the urge to bite the omega's neck and claim him, biting gihun's shoulder instead. gihun's mouth opened, but a sound didn't come out, instead he came again. he shook as the seed filled him with a much needed warmth. it felt so right.for a moment, everything stopped.the only sound was of their shared pants for air. gihun could still feel his hole being filled. his body felt better, warm from the sex and less by his heat.""i meant everything i said,"" sangwoo spoke, breaking the silence.""me too. i've wanted you for years, sangwoo,""sangwoo rubbed his thumb on the omega's hip in the circle.""all this time and this is how we finally say it,"" gihun spoke, ""here of all places and with your knot in me,""the omega laughed dryly, a bittersweet feeling etching its way into his mind.sangwoo moved one of his hand's to the omega's neck. gihun could smell the alpha's displeasure through his scent, knowing sangwoo wanted to mark him.""when we get out of here, can you promise to mark me?""sangwoo spoke, ""don't ask something so obvious, of course i will,""gihun laughed.after some time, sangwoo pulled out as his knot finally deflated. the seed dripped out from gihun's hole, and sangwoo growled. the alpha swiped the falling drip up and forced it back inside the omega, causing gihun to whine. sangwoo helped clean up gihun's excess slick before they dressed, yanking their pants and shoes back on.sangwoo swapped their positions and sat on the toilet, pulling gihun into his lap. sangwoo sniffed into his neck, scenting him.""you must really like my scent?""""it smells like home,"" sangwoo muttered.gihun stiffened, looking fondly at the alpha. he moved the alpha's face from his neck, staring at him in the eye. they took each other in, both of them with red cheeks and trembling hands. gihun pulled sangwoo face close to his and they kissed. sangwoo pulled gihun closed, making the omega fully straddle him. they kissed as if were the last time they would be able to, tongues lacing together and breath heavy. sangwoo's hands moved to the omega's hair and the omega grasped onto the alpha's shoulders.""i love you,"" gihun blurted in between their kisses.sangwoo froze.""ah, was that too soon""sangwoo yanked him back to kiss him again, pulling away after.""i love you too, gihun,""gihun and sangwoo locked eyes, the omega knew this was his true mate. the only alpha for him. maybe it was impulsive, but it had been years and neither of them were getting any younger.""bite me, now,"" gihun begged.sangwoo wasn't hesitant, bring the omega close and hovering his mouth over gihun's neck.""are you sure?""gihun nodded, ""i am,""sangwoo bit into his neck, causing the omega to whine from both pain and pleasure.he was finally claimed by the only person he had ever wanted.sangwoo pulled away, admiring the bite.""my omega,"" he whispered.""yours,"" gihun replied.the voice outside the door of the restroom broke the moment.""come out now!""sangwoo and gihun shared one more kiss, exiting the stall.as they passed the sinks, gihun glanced at the bite on his neck. a smile on his lips. sangwoo grabbed his hand and pulled the omega close, sharing one last chaste kiss.""let's get out of here together,"" gihun spoke and sangwoo nodded.""we will,""sangwoo wouldn't keep his word in the end, gihun would be alone and still in love with his alpha for the rest of his life. maybe it was their mistake thinking it would end happily for them.however, right now, they were just newly mated lovers trapped in hell.in this moment, in this fragment of time, they had loved each other."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34130629,out of time,moominii,"in their simple childhood days, gihun would always drop sangwoo off at their local cram school. he would ride them both in his old bike, speeding down the streets in his usual brazen manner. sangwoo would clutch on for his life, arms tight around gihun’s waist.“you know, one of these days, we’ll probably die with how you ride this thing,” sangwoo screamed into gihun ear, his body flushed against gihun’s body. sangwoo could smell gihun shampoo, a combination of ylangylang and sandalwood. it was a nice smell.gihun merely laughed, “have some faith in your hyung, i know what i’m doing.” he rounded a corner and nearly crashed into a pole.sangwoo rolled his eyes, gihun may be the oldest but he rarely acted like it.the bike screeched to a halt in front of sangwoo’s cram school. sangwoo got off hurriedly, already missing the warm heat emanating from gihun. “thanks for the ride, hyung.” sangwoo took the bike helmet and gave it back to gihun, who always rode his bike without one. sangwoo wished he did though.gihun grinned, his boyish charm was evident. “ah, i can’t have my genius falling behind. have fun studying numbers and stuff.” gihun winked, he took the helmet and set it in the basket of the bike. “i’ll be here to pick you up, so don’t waste time talking to your teachers again. i don’t want to freeze my ass off in the cold.”he ruffled sangwoo hair, messing it up. sangwoo groaned and pushed gihun’s hands away. “i’m not a child anymore.”“oh,” gihun smirked, “tell me that when you have grown taller.”sangwoo watched as gihun rode off. he could still feel the heat of gihun’s hand on his head. why was he so warm all the time? gihun was like a living furnace.sangwoo felt a gnawing sensation in his heart.xxx“you got into seoul university,” gihun said. “and you want to stay inside and mope around. come one, sangwoo, celebrate. let me treat the genius of ssamundong.” gihun was standing outside of sangwoo’s home, trying to entice him outside. sangwoo wanted nothing more than to sleep off exam anxieties. he almost threw up in the middle of his entrance exam from the stress alone.“oi, sangwoo, go out with gihun, you need to have some fun.” sangwoo’s mother cried out from the kitchen. she was cooking sangwoo favorite tonight, her voice was flushed with overwhelming pride.gihun hurled his arm around sangwoo pulling him close, and whispered in his ear; “i got soju, stole some from my mother’s stash.” gihun smirked when he saw sangwoo’s face.“we’ll be back,” gihun yelled out to sangwoo’s mother and pulled sangwoo with him. they both rushed out, hand in hand. gihun laughed, “sangwoo, you’re still in your pajamas.”sangwoo glared halfheartedly, “maybe because you didn’t let me change. but still, hyung, you shouldn’t steal soju.” he might as well be the voice of reason and decorum in this relationship.“eh, it’s only three bottles. we’re not going to get that drunk.” gihun slid his arms around sangwoo’s shoulders. “loosen up, genius boy.”gihun was being rather tactile tonight, even more so than usual. sangwoo could feel gihun’s warm breath fanning his neck as he spoke, his arm curled around sangwoo in a rather possessive manner. sangwoo wondered what was going on with him.soon, they were sitting outside on gihun’s roof, drinking chamisul soju along with an array of junk food between them.“so, excited for university? seoul is such a big city too, sounds like fun even though you’ll be taking such boring classes” gihun chugged his shot of soju. sangwoo poured him another one. “be sure to keep in touch okay?” gihun slurred out, he was already drunk after four shots.sangwoo poured himself a shot and chugged it down. “sure i’m excited, it’s a new chapter.” he sighed, “i want to leave anyway. it’s too small here.”gihun was silent for a change, he stared at sangwoo before he replied back. “yeah, it’s too small here. especially for you.” his voice was filled with the utmost tenderness as he stared at sangwoo through halflidded eyes.sangwoo felt the heat rise to his cheeks. “hyung, i think you drank too much.” sangwoo took the bottles out of gihun reach and placed them far away. he’ll throw them away later when he felt a little less reckless.he wanted to kiss gihun senseless right now. the feeling wasn’t new but for once sangwoo believed that reciprocation would be possible.gihun bemoaned the loss of soju and slumped down onto the roof tile, his arms crossed over his eyes. “you know, i…” gihun trailed off.sangwoo laid down next to gihun. they both watched the clouds go by, silent except for the warm rustling of the wind and their mellow breathing.“i’ll miss you,” gihun whispered out. “i don’t want you to leave.” it was so faint that sangwoo almost didn’t hear it.in a moment of uncharacteristic bravery, sangwoo grabbed ghun’s hand and held it. he wondered if gihun will forget about this when he wakes up tomorrow with a hangover. he probably will be given how lightweight he is right now.a moment of silence before sangwoo said, “i’ll miss you too.” he turned to face gihun, who was already asleep. sangwoo rolled his eyes affectionately, he’ll have to drag gihun’s body down to his room.with a resigned sigh, sangwoo cradled gihun’s body and brought him down from the rooftop. he tucked gihun into bed and cleaned after their mess on the rooftop, he threw the remainder of the soju away. alcohol and gihun made for a dangerous combination for sangwoo.xxxyears go by. sangwoo attended university. gihun becomes a married man and a father.sangwoo received an invitation to the wedding. the thought of gihun belonging to someone else increased the gnawing feeling in his heart.he dumped the invitation into the trash. he’ll send a bouquet of daffodil to the couple as an apology for not going.sangwoo grabbed some red wine from the pantry and chugged it down. he needed to forget. the gnawing sensation only grows.xxx“oi! sangwoo, you idiot.” gihun pounded on the door of sangwoo apartment. “open up! i wanna talk.”they were both released from the squid game, along with everyone else. gihun needed to make sure sangwoo was okay. and he needed a friend right now. gihun trembled, the image of his mother lying in the hospital bed pained him.sangwoo opened the door, in wet clothes and a bottle of soju in his hand. “hyung?”gihun pushed past him and into the apartment. sangwoo closed the door and followed gihun into the apartment. gihun grabbed the bottle of soju from sangwoo’s hand and took a sip before flopping onto the couch.“are you going to tell me what’s wrong or just invade my home and drink my soju?” sangwoo sat down next to gihun who took another sip.gihun looked at sangwoo. “my mom…” he signed. “she’s sick. i can’t pay for the medical care she needs.”sangwoo got up and went to his fridge and grabbed another bottle of soju, handing it over to gihun. “here, drink up.”they sat there, side by side, passing a bottle of soju between them. a laughable parody of their youthful moment on the rooftop all those years ago. sangwoo laughed.gihun turned and looked at sangwoo, “what’s so funny?” he emptied the bottle of soju.“how did we end up like this? miserable and pathetic, in debt because of our stupid decisions. it’s funny, isn’t it,” sangwoo laughed sardonically. gihun shrugged in response, not finding any humor in all this.gihun got up and pulled sangwoo up with him. “you need to change out of your wet clothes, you’ll get sick.”“does it even matter?” sangwoo said, “i’ll be going to jail soon anyway. the perfect genius has fallen down.”“don’t be like that,” gihun whispered, he dragged sangwoo to his bedroom and pushed him onto the bed. gihun opened the closet and pulled out a fresh set of clothes, laid them out next to sangwoo, who only stared at gihun as he kneeled down and began to unbutton his shirt. “you never kept in touch, sangwoo. to think a life and death game connected us again, now that’s funny.”gihun fingers lingered as he slowly unbuttoned sangwoo’s shirt. the tension was heavy and thick in the air.“i’m sorry,” sangwoo said, and he meant it. he felt the all too familiar sensation of regret. “i was selfish.”gihun peeled the wet shift off sangwoo and threw it on the floor. he grabbed the clean shift and put it on him. sangwoo let him, it has been a long time since someone cared for him like this. “get up, you’re pants are wet too.” sangwoo obeyed without a word.sangwoo should have been embarrassed to be treated like a child and having his clothes be put on him like this. but he didn’t care. it was a comfort right now.“thank you.” sangwoo sat back down on his bed, and gihun joined him.gihun chuckled, “yeah well, you looked gross in those wet clothes anyway. what were you even doing anyway?”“i was getting drunk in the bathtub.”“oh wow, that is really pathetic, sangwoo,” gihun said. sangwoo laughed in response. he faced gihun and took in his tired features, life hasn’t been treating either of them well.“you know, sangwoo, i always loved you.” gihun smiled, he stretched down on the bed in a catlike manner.sangwoo started at gihun, not expecting those words to come out of gihun’s mouth. “what?” maybe he misheard those words.“i had such a huge crush on you, but you were far too good for me. you deserved better,” gihun said with a melancholic expression on his face. “you left for college. i thought you would find a pretty girl and marry her, have kids and stuff. but instead, here we are.”sangwoo laid down beside gihun and rested his head on gihun’s shoulder. he didn’t say anything at first, merely processing those sweetly spoken words. he dreamed of them often, but nothing compared to reality. sangwoo briefly wondered if maybe he passed out and was dreaming of this. he reached out and pinched gihun on the cheek. gihun flinched in pain. “hey, that hurt!”“sorry, just wanted to make sure this wasn’t a dream.” sangwoo pinched himself as well, much to gihun amusement.gihun rolled his eyes, “is my confession so horrible that you think it’s a nightmare?”“no,” sangwoo grabbed gihun’s hand. “i llove you too, always have. but i was a coward and you got married. so i gave up.” sangwoo he wondered how different his life would have been if he kept gihun as close as he wanted to. if he actually fought for him rather than giving up.“oh really, then we’re both idiots.” gihun inched closer to sangwoo, so close that sangwoo could count gihun eyelashes if he wanted to. “but at least we both know now.”“yes, but too late now. i’ll be put on trial and you probably won’t see me again.”“don’t say that,” gihun said sadly. “have some hope.”“do you have hope? your child is leaving for american and your mother is on the verge of dying, and the amount of debt you have is just as paralyzing as mine.”gihun pinched sangwoo’s checks. “shut up for once, sangwoo. life sucks, but the future is never set.” sangwoo closed his eyes, he supposed gihun was right to some extent, but his view was still naive.sangwoo leaned his forehand against gihun’s forehead, breathing deeply and slowly till his heartbeat matched with gihun’s.“we’ll figure it out, we have time,” gihun said. he closed the distance between them with a kiss, so enticingly sweet that sangwoo could almost cry. soon they were throwing clothes aside and making up for the lost time between them.all the while, a card slipped through sangwoo’s door. a return to the squid game, another chance."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34265242,Sweet smiles,orphan_account,"the soft yellow tinted light emitting from the giant cash prize above barely makes sangwoo’s surroundings visible. everyone else seems to be asleep, hidden away in their own bases. it’s crazy, he thinks to himself, how just a few days ago this barren room was filled with hundreds of people just like him. he has watched so many people with so many different lives and stories be murdered and the best he can do is bat an eye. he doesn’t want to end up like them. he’s worked hard to still be alive, he is going to make it out of here alive and with the money that teasingly floats above him.“hyung?” a voice from beside him startles him from his thoughts. he turns his head and is met with curious eyes, “sorry, i thought you were starting to fall asleep.” ali lets out a sheepish laugh before taking a bite from his corn. “no, no, i was just deep in thought.” ali smiles at him, his eyes crease at the corners and he tilts his head slightly. it’s such a precious smile. a smile that sangwoo doesn’t deserve to see, a lying fraud like him shouldn’t have such a sweet boy give him such a genuine smile. ali is too sweet to be here, a young man like him shouldn’t be worrying if he will have enough food to feed his family. sangwoo isn’t the type to feel for others, he tries to be logical at most times but his brain seems to make an expectation for ali. he knows the most likely outcome to win the game and get the money is to be a sole survivor but despite how hard he tries to push it down the thought of getting out of here with ali stands prominent.he knows it’s only been a few days of knowing each other, but being in the situation they are in together strong relationships are bound to happen. he knows it's wrong, he knows ali is a married man, but he can’t help the things he imagines. how is he not too, ali’s always big and innocent eyes would send any desperate, lonely man into a spiral. sangwoo can’t help but want to hold his face in between his calloused hands, run those hands through those beautiful dark curls ali wears on his head like a crown. and his lips, so many thoughts flutter in his brain, so plump and practically begging to be kissed. sangwoo likes to imagine how ali would act when flustered, how obediently he would let sangwoo take control, how beautiful his noises would be. sometimes sangwoo's mind goes someplace where it definitely shouldn’t, he wonders how ali’s curious eyes would study it, how lips as plump as his would feel great wrapped around it, how gentle and patient he would be, how he wouldn’t think of himself only focused on making sure sangwoo felt good.he’s sure that if it weren’t for the hand softly shaking his shoulder his mind would’ve wandered even further. “what are you thinking about that has you this deep in thought?” ali asked, still wearing that smile that sangwoo will never get tired of. sangwoo knows he shouldn’t tell him what he was thinking about, it would ruin allegiances and leave him even more ruined than he is and being emotionally wrecked is not a place someone would want to be in during the games. but, another part of his brain, the part of his brain that's more whimsical than logical, thinks that if he told him his wrongful desires might become reality.“ali, have you ever kissed a man?” ali’s smile falters slightly and his mouth opens to say something then closes again. his darker toned cheeks take on a faint blush as his eyes stare into sangwoo’s with confusion, “nno, why?” sangwoo felt a smile tug fainlty on his lips, the image alone of ali flustered had his imagination running wild. “i was just wondering, since it is quite likely that we don’t make it out, wouldn't it be nice to try something you’ve never done before?” ali furrows his eyebrows and his mouth lays slightly agape, “have you ever kissed a man, hyung?” ali’s voice is quieter than before, barely audible as before they spoke in whispers as to not awaken the other players. sangwoo nods, “yes, so i can make sure it will be a good kiss.” sangwoo reaches across and pushes a loose curl away from ali’s eye, “do you want to do it?” he rests his hand on the side of ali’s face and watches as ali’s mouth opens and closes before settling on a nod.sangwoo allows a smile to grow on his face, not a big one but a genuine one to let ali know it's alright. he cups his hand under ali’s chin and gently strokes his thumb over his reddened cheek. ali’s lips stay partially open and his wide eyes stare into sangwoo’s. sangwoo breathes in before slowly leaning in and capturing ali’s lips with his own.he’s not a religious man but the only word sangwoo could use to describe it would be heavenly. his plump, inexperienced lips make sangwoo sick with need. he would keep going until they were both about to pass out from lack of breathing but he wants to be gentle and kind with ali so after only a few seconds he parts their lips leaving a trail of spit connecting their lips. ali’s wide eyes are still on him and his breathing is slightly quicker. sangwoo’s hand still held him and his thumb moved instinctively and slowly moved up and down, sometimes grazing over his lips. “how was that?” sangwoo whispered, face only a few inches away from ali’s. ali answered his question by leaning up and kissing sangwoo.sangwoo took a few seconds to process before leaning into the kiss and using his other hand to cup ali’s other cheek, pulling him closer. a sound akin to a whine came from ali and it only made sangwoo push deeper into the kiss. when they part for air both are breathless, ali’s desperate pants drive sangwoo crazy. ali grabs the collar of sangwoo’s jacket, pulling him down into another kiss. sangwoo drags one of his hands through soft curls as he and ali lose themselves. it’s not until sangwoo hears the rustle of blankets somewhere in the room that he comes back to his senses and pulls away, he has to gently push back an eager ali whose eyes and mind are foggy with desire.“we should go to the bathroom, we don’t want to risk anyone seeing us.” sangwoo looked around and then back to ali who let go of sangwoo and nodded. sangwoo stood up, helped ali stand up who wouldn’t take his eyes away from sangwoo. they reach the door and a guard leads them to the bathroom door, once they enter and the door behind them is shut sangwoo turns around and pulls a keen ali towards him.lips interlocked, they exchange lustful breaths as sangwoo backs ali into a stall. they part for air until ali starts to pull sangwoo back down, instead sangwoo trails kisses from his lips down to his neck. ali lets out a soft whimper and tightens his grip on sangwoo’s hair. sangwoo leaves soft kisses around his neck till he comes to a part on the underside of ali’s jaw, amidst ali’s loud panting when sangwoo kissed him there a quiet moan was heard. sangwoo noticed that and continued to kiss that spot. when he starts to suck and pull the skin with his teeth ali covers his mouth with his hand but still the muffled moans and whimpers are music to sangwoo’s ears. sangwoo reached up and removes ali’s hand, relishing in the beautiful sounds before he kisses back up to his lips and lets them hover in front of each other for a few moments, “how far do you want to go?” he looks into ali’s eyes, which still look at him with the same curiosity and innocence he had looked at him back when he gave him the bus fare. ali takes a moment to catch his breath, “however far you want to go, i'll try my best, hyung.”sangwoo can’t tell if he’s dreaming. he thinks, maybe he died in the last game and this is heaven; but a man like him wouldn’t stand a chance at getting in. ali would never do or say any of these things to a disgusting excuse of a human being that sangwoo was. in no circumstance would he realistically have ali wrapped around his finger tips, willing to do whatever sangwoo wanted, allowing sangwoo to abuse his lips and neck with his own. he is taken out of his thoughts by a soft voice, “hyung?” sangwoo opens his eyes, and he is met with the same beautiful sight of those all to familiar wide eyes. the feeling of ali’s breath against him, and the sound of his stuttered breath, and the feeling of ali’s face in his hands are too real to be a dream. he lets go of ali and sits down on the toilet seat, ali stands above him confused and unmoving.“can you get on your knees for me?” he can feel his boxers start to strain when ali slowly drops onto his knees in front of him, looking up at sangwoo for more instructions. sangwoo brings his hand forward and runs it through impossibly soft curls before bringing the hand to his trousers. he pulls them down to his ankles, “do you want to?” he asks, ali nods. “can you use your words?” sangwoo’s hand returns to his hair and softly runs his hands through it. “yes.” ali replies breathless.sangwoo removes his hands from ali and leans back, he makes a face suggesting to ali to go ahead. ali reaches his hands out and wraps his fingers around the hem of sangwoo’s boxers and gently starts to pull them down. sangwoo let out a low groan as his dick was freed from his tight restraints. he heard a slight gasp from below. ali finished pulling down sangwoo’s boxers and studied the decently sized length in front of him, he’s hesitant he’s never done this before but he seems to have made sangwoo quite excited already so he must be doing an alright job.sangwoo sucks in a sharp breath and closes his eyes when he feels ali’s nervous hand softly wrap around his length. ali starts to slowly move his hand up and down, from above he can hear sangwoo’s breathing stutter. the raw skin on skin probably isn't the most pleasurable, ali thinks, so he leans forward with his mouth just above the tip of sangwoo’s dick and opens his mouth partially to let his spit drip down as lubrication. sangwoo gasped at the feeling, struggling to hold back a groan when ali started to move his hand again. the added lubrication adds to the sensation and has sangwoo tilting his head backwards. when he opened his eyes the sight alone of ali so focused on the movement of stroking his hand up and down nearly sent sangwoo over the edge.ali’s hand movements continue for a minute or so, sometimes letting his thumb drift over the slit on the tip of sangwoo’s dick. his spit mixed with sangwoo’s precum seemed to be pleasing sangwoo but ali wanted to make sure that sangwoo was able to cum and it didn’t seem to be enough. so he leans forward and slowly drags his velvety tongue from the base to the tip, sangwoo’s hand quickly jerks forward and grabs ahold of ali’s hair as he runs it through his fingers, humming approvingly. ali licks across the slit and a groan can be heard from the back of sangwoo’s throat.ali eventually puts the tip of sangwoo’s dick in his mouth and feels the grip in his hair tighten and start to push down as the breathing from above quickens. ali try’s a few different things, trying to see what gets the best reaction out of sangwoo. he starts to swirl his tongue around the tip, the slightly salty taste of sangwoo’s precum isn’t that bad.sangwoo’s grip on his head tightens even more and suddenly starts to push him down, the sudden movement makes ali pull away and stare up at sangwoo with an adorable pout, red face and drool mixed with precum dripping down his face. sangwoo simply laughs and leans forward and pulls ali into a kiss, licking the drool from his lips and tasting himself isn’t something he would’ve imagined himself liking. he bites rather harshly on ali’s lips and the pained whimper ali makes makes sangwoo’s toes curl.he pushes ali’s head back towards his leaking dick and ali immediately dives back in, taking his tip in his mouth so gently just like how sangwoo had imagined. ali slowly makes his way further down sangwoo’s dick, having to come back up to make sure he can breathe alright a few times.sangwoo can feel himself coming closer and closer to the edge. he looks down at ali whose eyes are closed and whose head slowly moves up and down while his hands settle on sangwoo’s knees. sangwoo’s previous gentle hold on ali’s hair turns harsh as he grips onto it, ali lets out a beautiful muffled moan that vibrates through sangwoo’s entire body. sangwoo pushes ali down further and keeps him there as he rolls his eyes back and lets out a deep groan as he releases into ali’s mouth.ali loudly whimpers at the sudden movement which was followed by a load of salty tasting liquid spilling into his mouth. he tried to swallow as much as possible. sangwoo eventually came down from his high and released his grip on ali, who looked like a wreck; his usual wide eyes where slightly closed and fogged with lust, his hair stuck to his forehead and stood up in places where sangwoo had grabbed, his entire face was flushed a deep red, a hickey had started to form on the underneath of his jaw and cum spilled from his plump, used lips which stayed open as his pants passed through them.sangwoo leans forward and uses his thumb to drag across ali’s lips to collect his cum then puts his thumb into ali’s mouth who obediently licked it all off. sangwoo nearly came undone again at the sight of it. he pulled his thumb out and cupped ali’s face pulling him into a sweet slow kiss.“did i do good, sangwoo?” ali quietly asked in between pants as a calloused hand caressed his cheek. sangwoo hums and kisses him again, when the part for air he runs his thumb over red abused lips, “you did an incredible job, ali.”"

""sangwoo, stop!""sangwoo reluctantly lets gihun go, blinking apathetically at him.+sangwoo is ten when he discovers masturbation. it's late at night, and he's alone in his bedroom, clad in only a white tank top and boyish underwear, and he's thinking about gihun when he starts to feel funny down there. he thinks about a few days before, when he had put his tongue in the older boy's mouth, and how his body had felt hot.he slides off his underwear, to get a better look, and sees his dick, hard. he runs a finger across the tip, and he shudders. it feels good. he does it again, and again, until he has his dick grasped firmly in the entirety of his little hand and he's pumping furiously.he imagines gihun touching him there, or touching gihun there, or anything involving gihun, and it isn't long before he feels some weird buildup in his stomach. he starts to wonder if gihun does this too, wonders how he looks and the noises he makes while doing it; then his legs tremble, he gasps out gihun's name, and he bites down on his bottom lip.he masturbates a lot after that.+gihun is thirteen, and his interest in girls is only to be expected, but it still crushes sangwoo when he starts to talk about the pretty and popular soojin. the two boys are in the school bathroom, when he brings her up for the final time, and gihun has a stupid, shiteating grin on his face. like he just won the lottery, and it makes sangwoo repulsed.""she invited me to go see a movie,"" he gushes. he punches the air in excitement and sangwoo scowls. ""hey, hey, don't look like that. i know a girl i can set you up with.""""no thanks,"" sangwoo says blankly, his eyes glued to the sink now as he scrubbed at his hands fervently, trying to get gihun's smile and the way his eyes lit up when he talked about her out of his mind.gihun stared at him in disbelief. ""what, have you already got a girl in mind?""""i don't have time for those things,"" replies sangwoo, and his voice is strained, tilted.gihun smiles, teases, ""ah, yes, the great sangwoo of ssangmundong. he doesn't have time for girls, he's going to change the world.""sangwoo says nothing, so gihun leans closer, obnoxiously, invading his personal space. his nostrils flare, and he flashes a look at the teenager, a warning, but gihun only shifts closer, puts his hand on sangwoo's shoulder. sangwoo's temper reaches a boiling point as he hits gihun's off and shoves him away, his elbows catching on the sink before his head smacked into the mirror.""ow, what the hell,"" whined gihun. ""jerk.""it's sangwoo's turn to smile, and lean in close, but instead of using his hands, he uses his mouth to place a rough kiss on gihun's lips. he leans back a few moments later, brushes the hair from gihun's eyes, and then flicks his forehead mockingly with his index finger. gihun flinched.""i thought we were done with that,"" he says, dumbfounded. sangwoo shrugs and walks out of the bathroom, not waiting for his friend.gihun brings a finger to his lips, disorientated, and decides that soojin isn't so great, after all.+gihun giggles drunkenly, staring up at the ceiling as sangwoo lays beside him, and he numbly points up at the ceiling and says, ""looks like popcorn.""sangwoo twists his head to stare at him in bewilderment. ""what?""""i don't know!"" gihun exclaims, and giggles again before the world around him spinned and he groaned.sangwoo had gotten him wasted, kept supplying more liquor even after gihun had way more than he could handle. but he was fifteen, he had never been drunk before, and he wanted to see what it felt like; when sangwoo used reverse psychology on him, challenging him to drink more and more, he couldn't say no.gihun closes his eyes, he could barely make out anything in the darkness of the room anywayswonders when the light had even been turnedoff, and he hardly registers the sound of jeans being removed. he groans, softly, mumbles something incoherent, but sangwoo doesn't stop. he throws his pants carelessly to the floor before sliding off his boxers.""sangwoo,"" gihun says, and although he doesn't say anything more, sangwoo knows he is asking him to stop. but he can't bring himself to care; he had wanted this for so long, and he was going to get what he wanted.""shh,"" mumbles sangwoo, and straddles gihun, placing his knees on either side of the boy's head. he gently opens gihun's mouth with two fingers deep inside, and replaces them with his dick a moment later. he fucks gihun's mouth carefully, sloppier the closer he gets, and comes down his throat a few minutes later when gihun starts to cry.""you're mine,"" sangwoo had whispered, and nuzzled his head into gihun's chest. ""forever.""when gihun confronts him the following morning, all uncharacteristically timid and full of selfdoubt, sangwoo defensively says he's making it all up. when gihun continues, sangwoo says he won't talk to him until he stops with the nonsense. so gihun gives up immediately and admits to making it up.+gihun is seventeen and sleeps long hours, nearly every day. sometimes he wakes up to sangwoo deep inside of him, and as soon as he is aware that gihun is awake, he slaps a hand over his mouth and then continues fucking into him. this time, however, sangwoo doesn't muffle his noises.""i want to hear you cry as i come inside you,"" he says, panting hard, and he's close.""sasangwoo,"" gihun chokes out and squirms, broken and pathetic, and it makes the other teenager come, his whole body shaking as gihun clenches tight around him.sangwoo slowly pulls out, feeling naked, and sighs. he hovers over gihun, leans down to press a soft kiss against his mouth.""gotta go now,"" he says, and pats gihun on the head. like he's an inferior dog, and it makes gihun sniffle.sangwoo slams the door hard as he leaves, and it causes the walls to shake. gihun scrambles for his clothes.he tries not to cry, and fails.+""sangwoo... no,"" slurs gihun and sangwoo watches him try to fight the drug.sangwoo had been planning this for at least a month, it had been a main fantasy of his for at least the past six months, turned on by it, and jerking up into his hand at night and fantasizing about what it would be like to fuck gihun while he was knocked out. sangwoo's eighteen, soon to go off to university, it might be the last chance he gets to try something like this, at least for a while, and he's not going to let this opportunity pass him by, not when gihun was already almost unconscious.""quiet, baby,"" sangwoo says. ""gonna put you on your stomach.""gihun doesn't object, can't object, so sangwoo flips him over and stuffs a pillow under his midsection. sangwoo presses his fingers, dry, roughly inside the man, and isn't bothered because he know gihim can't feel it. the man's head is hanging limp to the side.he straddles gihun, like he had done many times, grabs his spitcovered dick, lines it up, and pushes in. he groans low in his throat, peppers a few firm kisses against the back of gihun's neck, and begins to fuck into him hard. it's dirty, barely lubricated, rough sex, and it doesn't even feel that great at first, but sangwoo still loves it.he uses gihun like a doll, and he goes harder, faster and gasps out as his hand falls to the floor to hold up his frame as he pounds away. he comes, moments later, cock buried deep, and then pulls out in a daze, slumps down on his side next to gihun and stares, exhausted.he slowly slides his palm up the length of gihun's forearm before interlocking their fingers and pausing. he stays like this with him for a moment, his eyes flickering aimlessly across the room, before he spots his discarded pants lying a few feet away, and an idea buzzes inside of his twisted head.sangwoo smiles coldly. he gently takes hold of the other teenager's naked legs and pushes them apart. he exhales, readjusts the razor blade between his fingers, and gets to work.in deep, angry red letters; 'sangwoo' is displayed boldly, letters splayed and cut deep across the teenager's inner thigh. sangwoo smirks, demented.+"

you know i don’t do that anymore.” he scrambles to defend himself.sangwoo rolls his eyes and reaches for the gauze, let’s his slender fingers move over gihuns swollen knee.they’re sitting on top of sangwoo’s terrace. the sky has fallen into darkness in every corner; the only light engulfing them being the street lights scattered all across ssangmundong.the mellow color swarms his vision as it reflects off of sangwoo’s glasses. he is too busy healing gihun with his calloused hands to notice his indecent staring.he does, however, have a peripheral vision.“stop staring.”gihun immediately flickers his eyes to the side, suddenly transfixed on the dampness of the cement beneath him.he feels a set of nimble fingers on his face, and his heart lurches up to his throat, he feels it in his adam’s apple. sangwoo is holding onto his face, and he tenderly brings up a cotton ball towards his cheek.gihun immediately hollers out in protest.“shit! sangwoo, that fucking stings! what the hell?!” the teenager practically squawks at him.this is the first time sangwoo cracks a smile all evening, and it’s one of those special smiles, one that he reserves only for gihun when they’re alone.he’s pretty under the moonlight.“don’t be a dumbass and get yourself hurt then.”sangwoo grabs his face again, but presses the cotton more gently this time. gihun only hisses under his touch and unravels beneath him.“but then we won’t share moments like these anymore,” gihun practicallypoutsat him.the pride and joy of ssangmundong let’s his face fall back to stoic, pressing onto gihun’s wound just enough to edge him for being a brat. it earns him a yell and a slap on the wrist.“not funny!”“it was a little.” despite no laughter coming out of his mouth, he is amused.after gihun is littered with patches, they lean against the railing in silence, enjoying each other's company while it lasts.it’s rare when it gets to be just them two. gihun frowns at the thought of sangwoo going to college.he’s more than happy for him. he’s ecstatic, excited that his best friend gets such a grand opportunity. his brain will finally be put to good use.still, he can’t help but feel like a temporary token.something that will be tossed away with time.sangwoo will eventually make better friends at snu, go to parties, get a job, hell — maybe even start a family, and gihun will just be a distant memory.something that could’ve been but never became.he feels a pair of eyes set on him and he tries to force himself to not look back, to focus on the night sky and hope it swallows him whole.“what about you?”gihun turns his head.“what about me?”sangwoo takes a while to respond, let’s his eyes flicker over gihuns face for a few brief seconds.“where will you go for college?”gihun lets out a hearty laugh and shakes his head dismissively. it’s a little forced, but he hopes he sold it.he can’t believe that sangwoo could guess so easily about what he was thinking.“college isn’t really for me. too expensive, y’know.”“there are always other options, gihun. you can apply for scholarships, study abroad —“gihun cuts him off with a simple shake of the head.“trust me, i still have a long way to go in ssangmundong. i’m not going anytime soon.”sangwoo seems disappointed, but doesnt bring it up anymore. he knows when to respect gihun’s boundaries and let him blow off steam.he thinks it’s sweet that his best friend wants him to do something more fulfilling. it just doesn’t feel likehim.he’s not the college kind. sangwoo is.seeing himself become more than what he’s already become.he sees it, when he looks at sangwoo.and he is, he’s looking at him with fondness, a certain tenderness he only reserves for his best friend.he wonders if in another life, they would have never stayed friends. turning on each other for ignorant reasons.gihun thinks grimly, an image of sangwoo beneath him in a pool of blood, and suddenly he feels bitter to his core.thankfully, that isn’t their reality, and he pushes the intrusive thought away.sangwoo is fiddling with his fingers, a habit he’s always had since childhood. it means he wants to say something or do something, but is afraid. gihun already knows.gihun can’t think of a more enticing sight.he knows he will replay it multiple times in his head later.“i think i’m in love with someone.”and there it is.gihuns stomach drops as far as it can go and he thinks he’s never had this much anxiety pump through his veins before.his heart races and his pupils dilate, immediately looking sangwoo’s way.it’s impossible.sangwoo barely hangs around anyone other than him. he’s not the most sociable kid in their class, a stark comparison to gihuns piped up personality.sangwoo is looking everywhere besides him and it’s obvious that he regrets bringing it up. his mouth twitches with anticipation, but nothing comes out.gihuh tries to give him patience and ultimately fails after three seconds.“who?! i didn’t know you were talking to any girls! well, i knew a few girls liked you here and there, like minyeo for example, but i’m pretty sure she was just interested because you’re smart — ““it’s not a girl.”silence cuts through the air and gihun immediately stops his insistent rambling. he swears his heart might just go into cardiac arrest if sangwoo kept pulling on his ballsack like this.“stop playing with me, asshole!” he hits sangwoo on the shoulder, but he only returns the favor with a deadpan expression.gihun suddenly realizes that he is being serious. he looks nervous, albeit still stoic, waiting for gihun’s approval. he’s apprehensive, not sure if gihun will be weirded out or acceptive.his eyes flicker downwards and sangwoo’s eyes follow right after him.it happened all at once.gihun grabbed onto the collar of sangwoo’s shirt and they approached each other, almost scared to dance around each other this closely.their breaths linger for too long and sangwoo breaks the distance.it’s soft, not at all what gihun had expected. maybe even went above his expectations.then again, he never thought he’d be kissing his childhood best friend on his terrace, but there he was.he doesn’t even think about sangwoo’s silent confession, just takes him in, takes in the smell of fried fish and something akin to nostalgia.when they pull away for breath, sangwoo is looking at him like he’s the only thing that matters, and god, it makes gihun weak to his knees.he clutches onto his collar again and continues kissing his best friend.it felt all too wrong and all too right at the same time.the sweet moment is cut off when the lights from inside flicker on, prompting sangwoo and gihun to immediately latch off of each other.sangwoo’s mom slides the glass door open, hugging herself from the cold air.“what’re you boys doing out here so late?”she looks down at her watch and frowns.“it’s nearly 12am. come on inside and get some rest.”“yes, omma.”she smiles tiredly at them and then heads back into the house.gihun and sangwoo exchange breathless glances at each other, gihun cracking a mischievous grin and sangwoo becoming immediately embarrassed.“i can’t believe you were talking about me.”sangwoo covers his eyes bashfully, an emotion he doesn’t show too often to anyone.“can you imagine if your mom saw us?”“oh god, don’t even tell me.”"
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34089418,Wrong timing,ProSkater17,"sangwoo was so angry. he felt the blood boiling inside of him. he stood still with his fingers pressed into his fist and thought about his options. the lights on the bathroom seemed disturbingly bright. everything annoyed him. what annoyed him the most was that he didn’t know what about gihun. he felt immense anger towards him. but he also felt love. it was annoying that he didn’t know when the anger started and the love ended. their boundary had evaporated with the game, he thought. he wanted to strangle gihun, but he also wanted to kiss him and keep him close. everything seemed frustrating. he had survived this far, but so had gihun. he thought gihun would have died already during the second game. gihun had proven to be his worst enemy. however, why didn't he want gihun to die? his heart pounded for gihun. sangwoo leaned against the sink and allowed himself to think. if he had to be with gihun for a long time, he might not be able to restrain himself. he was dangerous to gihun. gihun was so oblivious. he wondered if they would have to stay in the end together. he would attack gihun and destroy him. he wouldn't kill him. he wanted gihun to be his own.""oh. sangwoo. here you are,"" gihun said as the door closed behind him. just like that? gihun arrived at the worst time. gihun had a beautiful smile. it was genuine and full of emotion. “i thought you went to the bathroom.” gihun continued and stepped closer. he smiled again and turned towards stalls. sangwoon's patience ran out. he didn't care at the moment. sangwoo grabbed gihun's collar with his hand and snatched him along. he dragged gihun at a fast pace to the other end of the room far away from stalls. sangwoo threw gihun against the cold wall. before gihun had time to react, sangwoo struck both of his hands on both sides of gihun. gihun was frightened and jumped a bit. his eyes were big and he squeezed his fingers together. ""sangwoo... wwhat are yyou ...?"", gihun stammered.sangwoo lowered his gaze down towards gihun. his gaze was dark and angry. it caused cold shivers in gihun. ""i want you..."" sangwoo whispered in a low voice. it took gihun a while to figure out what his friend ment. in a panic, gihun pushed his hand against sangwoo's chest to keep sangwoo from getting closer. ""hey. let's think about this sensibly,"" gihun began, feeling a drop of sweat run down his temple. sangwoo was not on a chat mood. he leaned closer to gihun, though gihun still held his hands against sangwoo's chest. sangwoo grabbed gihun's hips with one hand and gihun's cheek with the other. gihun tried to push sangwoo away with all his strength, but sangwoo didn't move. ""you are mine. you have always been and always will be,"" sangwoo whispered in gihun's ear. it almost sounded like a threat. sangwoo touched gihun's lips with his thumb and tightened his grip on his waist. sangwoo slapped his lips against gihun's mouth. gihun tried to retreat closer to the wall, but it didn't help. sangwoon's warm lips worked gihun's mouth open and he felt sangwoo's tongue against his own. it felt uncomfortable, but familiar and in a good way warm. gihun relaxed a bit and let sangwoo kiss him.it was a strong kiss. sangwoo retreated from the kiss and looked at gihun who was leaning tightly against the wall. his lips were beautifully red and covered with shiny saliva. the site only made sangwoo want more. gihun saw hunger from sangwoon's gaze. he looked at gihun, like a prey. sangwoo pressed his lips against gihun's neck and sucked a dark mark on the skin. ""stop sangwoo. don't leave marks! others may notice!"", gihun said in panic and tried to push sangwoon away. sangwoo grinned and licked gihun's neck, causing shivers in gihun. “that was my plan… everyone has to know that you’re mine,” sangwoo said.gihun yelped as sangwoo grabbed his other leg and lifted it higher. gihun was forced to put his hands around sangwoon's neck to keep him upright. sangwoo pushed himself against gihun. gihun moaned. it was embarrassing, but he was so surprised. ""ssangwoo... let's think about this. please..."" gihun said, but he felt sangwoongrinding against him. gihun tried to bite his lip to keep out the sounds, but it was hard. sangwoo pushed his hand under gihun's shirt. his cold fingers wandered against gihun's warm stomach until they found their target. gihun janked and yelped as sangwoo pinched his left nipple. then he fliked it. gihun couldn't say whether he was more upset about sangwoo's behavior or his own voices. sangwoo drew himself farther from gihun, but pulled gihun with him. he turned gihun around and pushed him against the cold sink. gihun clung tightly to the sink as he feared his legs would give out. he felt sangwoon press his fingers against his lower back. he felt sangwoo's breath full of anger on his neck. sangwoo grabbed the edge of gihun's pants and pulled them down. gihun squeezed the sink tighter. ""sangwoo! what if we get caught?"", gihun exclaimed, almost crying.“then you better be quiet,” sangwoo said, licking gihun’s ear. he grabbed gihun's underwear and pulled it down. gihun felt the cold air on his now bare skin. it was embarrassing. he tryed to wiggel his way out. it was useless. sangwoo had pressed tightly against gihun. gihun looked sideways as sangwoo pushed his hand into the soap pump. his hand now full of slippery handsoap, he pushed his hand to the lower end of gihun. gihun jerked himself against a sink. he felt sweat running down his forehead. sangwoo pushed his fingers in. gihun jelped and bit his teeth as sangwoo's finger wiggeled it's way in. gihun rested his forehead against the mirror. the finger didn’t feel bad and then it touched something. gihun let out a strange moan. sangwoo smiled. he gently pushed his other finger in and touched the same spot again. gihun moanded a little too loudly. it felt good. painful but good.gihun felt empty and slippery as sangwoo pulled his fingers out. there was a moment of silence. gihun looked up in the mirror and looked at sangwoo, who in turn stared at him through the mirror. gihun's hair was messed up. his lips were red and shiny because of the saliva. gihun's face had a reddish blush that continued all the way to his ears. his eyes were watery and glittering. sangwoo had never seen a more beautiful sight. gihun felt something thick against his entrance. he didn’t have time to say anything when sangwoo pushed himself violently in. gihun couldn't even describe the voice that came from him. soon sangwoo had gotten himself pushed as deep as possible. he then pulled himself almost out , but then pushed himself back in.he started at a steady pace and accelerated the pace from it. the skin hitting against the skin was a very sexual sound. gihun moaned and almost always screamed as sangwoon pushed back inside him. gihun's legs didn’t worked, but luckily sangwoo supported him from the waist with his strong hands. the pace became punishing. gihun has never been so fucked. he would have trouble walking tomorrow. sangwoo raised his ass higher in order to hit gihun’s ass in from a different angle. he hit straight to target. gihun was a sobbing mess. it felt so good. ""sangwoo... i i can't hold iit anymore.... gotta ccome."" sangwoo understood. he wrapped his fingers around gihun’s member and started pumping. the spit drained along gihun’s chin into the sink. “come... come gihun.” sangwoo encouraged. didn't have to say twice. gihun came trembling against his stomach and sink. the sight through the mirror drove sangwoo on the edge too. he rode his orgasm into gihun. pulssing stopped. gihun layed against the sink and sangwoo against his back.after a moment of panting, sangwoo pulled himself out. he watched as his cum flowed out of gihun's ass to his thighs. gihun turned and leaned his back gently against the sink. sangwoo grabbed the handpaper and moistened it a bit. he came back and started cleaning gihun. finally, gihun pulled his pants back up. ""that's going to hurt tomorrow..."" gihun mumbled. “what did you say?” sangwoo asked. “if i can’t walk in the next game, then you get permission to either die with me or carry me,” gihun explained. sangwoo grinned ""deal."""
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34339738,in my arms tonight,anomochil,"sangwoo would not consider himself a romantic man.far from it, really. he had barely drabbled in dating, and when he did, he didn’t put in much effort. that’s how it was.he wasn’t affectionate, he didn’t smile at his lovers longingly, he didn’t fall asleep with them, he didn’t stay up with them late and cuddle.sangwoo was not a affectionate man. but then, a certain man had to change that.the first sign that something had changed, he wasn’t even in a relationship with ali.it was time to keep watch at the barricade again, saebyeok had gotten tired. sangwoo had nudged ali awake with care.his curls fell in front of his face messily, and his eyes groggily fluttered open with minor confusion. it didn’t help that there was a man crouching over his sleeping person, and the lack of lights made it hard to see. he squinted before realization flooded his face.“it’s our shift.” the korean reminded quietly, standing up. ali nodded slowly and rose from his position, rubbing his eyes with a muffled yawn. if sangwoo thought it was rather warming, he’d deny it.sangwoo made sure he wouldn’t fall back asleep before he made his way to the small space in the barricades, where they would sit for the remainder of their time.it was dead silent, there was no noise, save the occasional loud breaths of the sleeping teammates. it was only that he started to pay attention again when ali made his way beside sangwoo, sitting down with his knees to his chest.there was a silence that followed, ali gazing at the barricades he’d assisted with earlier that evening.“hopefully that will keep them out..” ali huffed, still a bit sleepridden. sangwoo’s eyes were brought to the other player as he broke the quiet, blinking at him with question. “i am afraid it won’t. they seem much stronger than us.”sangwoo tilted his head. his hair lolled to the side, and ali looked rather downcast, a contrast to the usual optimism his face shone with. a smile upturned sangwoo’s lips, and it was a rare sight.“don’t think so negatively.” sangwoo decided on, his voice low but intentional. ali’s wide eyes flickered to him. “you did a very good job with the barricade, and you’re stronger than you think, ali.”it was barely any praise, but ali’s face got a little more red and his face turned a little brighter. he fiddled with his fingers. “thank you, hyung.”sangwoo’s smiled only grew at the reaction, and he nodded. “i’m only saying the truth.”the second time, well; it wasn’t the most pleasant of times.the marble game was horrible. so many people partnered up with people they trusted, only to have them die. but sangwoo was desperate, and he came up with a plan. to play against other pairs.by some miracle, the plan actually worked. as soon as the other two players were eliminated, sangwoo pulled ali to the exit and ran back to the dorms.ali was no short of traumatized. he didn’t seem to be responding, his eyes were wide and glazed over, there were tremors throughout his body.sangwoo felt for him. ali was a kind man, and so of course this would affect him. sangwoo just didn’t realize how much.“ali, it’s okay.” sangwoo murmured lowly as they made it to the beds.there were murmurs around the two. none were happy, they sensed. gihun and saebyeok were there, having won the game. that meant.. well.ali winced, a high pitched sound of hopelessness. sangwoo just pulled him to a bed and wrapped him in his arms.“i know. but we survived.” he breathed, his chin resting atop the thick black curls. “and that’s enough.”ali wept into the player’s shirt, and sangwoo held on tighter.he and ali didn’t get to share any more affections throughout the rest of the games. there was too much stress, it was all so quick. passing gestures, simple but reassuring actions, but otherwise, there was no time. he’d never admit the fact, but sangwoo missed it.and then they won. all four— gihun, sangwoo, saebyeok, and ali— they made it out alive.they were dropped off on a dim lit street, which gihun mentioned he and saebyeok had been dropped off the time they’d opted out of the game, and they had their money.sangwoo almost didn’t believe it. all of the death, the manipulation, the things he had to do to survive— and now it was just, over. it was over.the first to react was gihun. a jerky breath was heard, and then he lunged to hug saebyeok. she didn’t pull away. she nudged her face into his shoulder and gave a small smile, tightly embracing him.sangwoo, his eyes widened in final realization of the situation they’d just gotten out of. ali was frozen in place. the pakistani was shocked, and sangwoo couldn’t just stay away from him.he pulled ali in suddenly, drawing a startled gasp from the other. “i told you, you are strong.”ali was tense for a long moment, but then there was a soft laugh and he looked at sangwoo with appreciation.in a moment of bliss, he put his lips to ali’s forehead in a gentle kiss, laughing a breathy laugh of near disbelief. ali made a sound of thanks.gihun looked at sangwoo with a glint of question in his eyes, but ultimately— they were all too glad to care about much of anything.the fact that sangwoo wasn’t a romantic person was flipped on its back once they had gotten out.all of them had sought out their families. saebyeok went to her brother, and started to work on saving her mother.gihun was able to talk to his daughter, and make amends with his exwife. his mother’s health had worsened, but he had the money to try and help her.ali had went to try and find his wife and his son. he promised to keep in contact, but we was rather preoccupied.and then there was sangwoo. the discussion he had with his mother was difficult. the last she’d heard of him was that he’d committed various crimes— so it wasn’t like she greeted him with inviting arms. but she did cry at the sight of him.he eventually got all of the legal stuff worked out. it wasn’t all gone, but he was in better shape, and that was enough for him.but, he couldn’t ignore, that in the back of his head, he itched for ali’s touch. he missed the man’s bright smile, his wide eyes. and he ignored that feeling, until a day came where he couldn’t.it was a rather boring day for sangwoo. he didn’t have plans, and nobody had contacted him that day. usually, his mom would interact with him in some type of way from day to day, but she was busy at work. gihun was visiting his daughter, and saebyeok didn’t talk to him through phone often.so, when there was a knock at his door, he quirked a brow. he hadn’t ordered anything, he figured. but, he made his way to the door anyway.and when he opened it, he stilled.it was a disheveled ali. he wore a casual tshirt and jeans, but his hair was messy atop his head and his eyes were puffy. sangwoo couldn’t tell if it was from crying or exhaustion.at the door’s opening, ali’s head shot up. his drooping eyes widened at the sight of sangwoo— in almost disbelief. they hadn’t seen each other in a while. it hadn’t been that long, but it had felt like it.“ali?” sangwoo spit out uselessly, wanting to break the quiet between the two of them. ali looked at him blankly, seeming in a daze.“my wife and my son are gone.” ali said, and sangwoo almost missed it with the volume of it. he seemed to snap out of it then, looking down at his hands. “i i don’t know why i am here, i should go. i’m sorry—““no, no.” sangwoo stopped him with haste, and he flinched. a hand was put onto ali’s shoulder, and sangwoo gave a small, saddened smile. “ali, come in.”sangwoo had sat him down, and asked him to explain. ali’s family had left their home, and ali couldn’t find them. he looked and looked, but nowhere. ali wept, crying to sangwoo with words like “what if they’re dead?” or “she probably thought i abandoned her.”sangwoo just held him.things had changed, since then. sangwoo invited ali into his home, he asked if he wanted to stay there.ali was quick to shut it down, muttering things of not wanting to intrude. but it happened that, ali ended up staying anyway.even if all the reaction he gave was a warm smile, sangwoo was beyond ecstatic. he had missed that face of ali’s. now he was here again. all his.his affection to ali was almost constant.it was too good to pass up, really. it wasn’t like ali ever rejected it, either. all the more to do it.on the couch, sangwoo draped his arm around ali. ali blinked at the sudden warmth against his shoulders. it pushed himself out of the focus on the movie that was on the television screen, illuminating the otherwise dark area.ali looked over inquisitively, but sangwoo kept his line of sight to the tv. ali didn’t move, and neither did sangwoo.if ali fell asleep on his shoulder an hour later; neither mentioned it.they were with gihun and saebyeok at sangwoo’s place, they had ordered takeout to eat on slowly while just basking in one another’s presence.“how is your family, saebyeok?” ali questioned absentmindedly.she answered simply, chewing and swallowing her seasoned noodles and thinking on it. “they’re doing fine. better.”“that’s good.” sangwoo added in politely. gihun perked up, seeming to having a thought before turning to his childhood friend.“mm, how’s your mother? i heard she’s been visiting you more recently.” he askedwith a mouth full of food. saebyeok looked at him with a face that didn’t read amusement.“oh, she’s been alright.” sangwoo replied easily. ali’s eyes flickered in between them all. and oh, sangwoo loved his curious eyes. he looked around in such happiness. sangwoo put a hand on his back, a subconscious touch as he tilted his head towards ali. “she’s always very glad to see me. and she likes ali.”ali chuckled bashfully, head dipping down to the floor. gihun smiled knowingly. sangwoo was oblivious to it.the hangout had turned into late, and the late turned into a sleepover. it wasn’t intentional, but they enjoyed each other’s company and weren’t too rushed to leave.sangwoo was the first to wake, an early bird, himself.they’d fallen asleep in the living room area. he and ali were on the couch, saebyeok in a mess of blankets on the floor, and gihun against the sofa sitting.sangwoo remembered when he owned an apartment, before the game. his place wasn’t nearly as spacious, not nearly as comfortable. he supposed that’s how it was for everyone in here, though. they’d all been in the same situation at one point or another.ali stirred sleepily, breaking sangwoo from his chain of thought. a smile broke on the korean’s face— ali looked so lovely in slumber. his hair was every which way, and his face seemed so at peace.he moved again, head lolling and landing on sangwoo’s leg. sangwoo paused, unsure of what to do.“ali,” he prodded quietly. he nudged his shoulder. “ali, it’s time to wake up. we should make breakfast for the others.”ali’s eyes twitched, and finally slid open with difficulty. he murmured unintelligible noises before finally coming to the realization that he’s been woken up.“mmph.. oh.” the pakistani sighed, rising up from his position as if he hadn’t been on sangwoo in the first place. “good morning..”sangwoo nodded at him, observing as he stretching and yawned out of grogginess. gihun and saebyeok were still fast asleep, but he predicted they’d most likely wake up soon.“did you sleep well?” sangwoo asked. his genuine question was masked by his normal flat tone, but ali appreciated it anyway.“mhm, my neck hurts though.” he replied with a chuckle. “that is probably what i get, for falling asleep on the couch.”sangwoo gave an amused smile in return, getting up from the cushion he was sat on. “i’ll go get out the things to make breakfast. you can join me if you want.”ali had indeed joined him, despite being a couple minutes later. he looked a bit more presentable now: his curls were brushed through briefly, and his clothes were straightened out.“what are you making?” ali asked, walking up to the counter beside his friend.“getting ready to make pancakes, right now.” sangwoo hummed in reply. his eyes glanced from ali to the ingredients, and back again. “would you like to help?”ali’s eyes lit up, and sangwoo basked in the sight. “of course, if you would want me to.”sangwoo gave a ghost of a smile, gesturing for him to take his place.and that’s how they ended up with ali stirring and mixing the ingredients in the batter, with sangwoo standing behind him watching.“i’m sorry, i am not the best at cooking.” ali huffed in goodnatured embarrassment, and sangwoo shook his head.“it’s okay,” sangwoo put his hand on ali’s bicep and leaned his chin down to meet ali’s other shoulder. “i think you are doing very well.”sangwoo couldn’t see his face, but the tone of his voice could make him chuckle. “ah— mm, thank you, sangwoo.”then there were footsteps, and the other two had joined them.sangwoo looked over: gihun looked at them like it was normal, at this point, and saebyeok— well, her eyebrows were raised while she muttered phrases of “it’s too early for this.”sangwoo cleared his throat awkwardly, pushing away from ali and asking if they were okay with pancakes.“you like ali.”the statement from his childhood friend caught him off guard, making him blink a few times and sit down his mug.“what?” sangwoo said blankly.gihun had a grin on his face, one sangwoo could read as sly. suddenly, he was glad ali wasn’t in the room.“you like ali.” the man repeated. his eyebrow quirked up, signaling his impatience.“i mean.. yeah, he’s a good friend.” it sounded like a desperate aversion, and it didn’t work.“oh, don’t play dumb with me, sangwoo! you have a crush on ali!”“no i don’t.”“yes you do. i’ve seen how lovesick you act around him!” to further prove his dramatized point, gihun put a hand to his head and fell back in a faux action of fainting.“how do you even mean?” at the counter, gihun leaned back up and looked at him deadpan. sangwoo’s eyes cast down to his hands, he thought about it. “do i? i don’t, do i?”gihun raised both his eyebrows. sangwoo’s eyes were on the floor.“oh, shit.”at the new revelation, was not well. he tried denying it many times, and gihun just pointed out the flaws in his logic. sangwoo was irritated. it’s not like he had a chance with ali. and now he had to face his hopeless, onesided pining forever? that sucked.“he won’t like me back.” sangwoo grunted stubbornly one day, while with gihun. ali was asleep in his room, and saebyeok had gone to the kitchen to fetch herself a glass of water.“but, how do you know that?” gihun was tired of arguing about the same thing for so long. sangwoo had brought it up so many times, and not given a reason as to why. it was like arguing with a brick wall, gihun mused.“because because he used to have a wife, you know?” sangwoo pointed out.“means basically nothing. what if he’s attracted to multiple genders?”sangwoo paused, and groaned under his breath. neither of them listened to each other, as insistent as they were when they were children. but, sangwoo figured, he had a valid point to be stubborn. if he confessed to ali, and ali didn’t reciprocate, their relationship would strain. it would be awkward and fake between them, and sangwoo would rather just pine. doing so seemed easier, ali would still be his friend and he would still be able to talk to the man.“did i miss something?”sangwoo jumped, looking to the source of the voice, and saebyeok was in the doorway. she held water with a complex expression on her face.now saebyeok knew of his little crush— just great.when sangwoo confessed, it was unintentional.he had been texting saebyeok; she had questioned him about his crush. thankfully, she hadn’t heard a name, but she was quick to guess. “it’s ali, isn’t it?” she’d said. sangwoo huffed.he’d been interrupted by a text from ali. the pakistani had been out for a walk, and he often notified sangwoo when he was home.“i’m home :” was the simple message he received, and sangwoo replied with “alright.” before clicking back to his list of contacts and going to saebyeok.he texted back an irritated confirmation and sent it. “yes, i have feelings for ali. you can stop asking me about it.”“?”“hyung?”“what do you mean?”“sangwoo?”he had fucked up terribly.sangwoo contemplated making an excuse. it was a prank? sangwoo would never do that, it was too out of character. he was drunk, maybe? there was no alcohol in the house. ali was muslim, and he and his mother just didn’t think of it. he didn’t mean ali? that just wasn’t believable. ali wasn’t stupid.ali shifted in his seat across from sangwoo, and sangwoo felt his stomach twist.“did you mean it?” ali mumbled, his tone more tentative than it usually was.sangwoo’s head tilted up. “what?”“did you mean what you said?”a sharp inhale of breath.“i did.”ali’s fidgeting hands stilled, and he returned the gaze sangwoo gave him. his face was unreadable— it was such a contrast from the easily read expressions he commonly wore, and sangwoo hated it. it made him feel even worse.sangwoo looked at the ground, sighing harshly and swallowing. “i’m sorry, that must be weird. i’m sorry.”ali got up then, and sangwoo was confused. was he leaving? sangwoo supposed he understood. the pakistani made a few steps forward, and sangwoo was prepared to say goodbye.but then, he sat down beside sangwoo. his eyes were glued to the ground, he seemed flushed and hesitant. “i have feelings for you too.”sangwoo froze. he looked at ali, who was now flustered and seeming to consider running out of the room.“really?”“yes yeah.”sangwoo didn’t react, he just stared. until he broke out into a smile. a genuinely happy smile, and ali looked up at him with adoration in his eyes.“ali, do you think,” ali tilted his head, he looked more sure of himself now. “do you think i can kiss you?”ali’s mouth fell open an inch, a subtle show of his surprise. sangwoo laughed softly, and ali nodded at him dumbly.“good.” sangwoo’s eyes held admiration in them now. he studied ali’s face, his eyes, his nose, and lastly; his lips. they were pinkish brown and lush, perfect to kiss.and so, that’s what sangwoo did. he leaned in slowly, they both closed their eyes, and their lips touched.the kiss was warm, and reassuring for both of them. sangwoo put a hand on ali’s arm, and ali pressed in closer. sangwoo smiled wider.when they pulled away for air, their foreheads stay in contact, their eyes still drooped close in content. ali made a sound of joy. sangwoo huffed in amusement, and he murmured lowly to his ali.“you’re all mine, ali.”and ali didn’t object."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34269919,why must it be so hard,anomochil,"the dorm was eerily quiet.of course it was, it was lights out— but it didn’t stop sangwoo from noticing the continuous shakes of the man beside him.sangwoo was glad ali was on watch with him— he was the strength of the team, and sangwoo was the self proclaimed intelligence. they made a good pair. but, despite ali’s strength, he still shook.“ali,” sangwoo said in a whisper, watching him intently. ali flinched. the pakistani blinked owlishly, registering what had been said and by who. he seemed to have realized sangwoo’s call by then, looking to him.“ah, yes, sorry.” ali said, breathily chuckling. sangwoo was fairly sure the chuckle was not amused. “is there something wrong?”sangwoo let out an exhale, eyes fluttering. he wasn’t completely sure of what to say, really. ‘you’re shaking like a scared fawn’, mm? he wasn’t going to say that.sangwoo decided on a question more warm, more encouraging for ali to open up. “are you alright?”ali smiled, albeit uncomfortably. the room was dim, if not almost completely black. the brown skinned man tried squinting. it didn’t work.“ii’m fine, sir. just uh, what was it— jittery.” ali scrambled for the right word with haste. sangwoo remained still, a spell of calm forcing itself upon him.“any reason as to why?” sangwoo questioned.ali closed his eyes momentarily. sangwoo noticed how he forced his foot to stop tapping, and his shoulders to relax. sangwoo’s mouth curled into a frown.he knew he should make friends in this place, he shouldn’t become close with any of these people. he already had gi hun to worry about. but, any more relationships and it could make him weak. it could make him lose.but he couldn’t help his care for #199, the man he met only a few days ago. ali was kind, strong, and nearly selfless. he’d seen the face of determination in the game of red lightgreen light, how he didn’t even struggle to hold a terrified looking gi hun. even if sangwoo didn’t bother to show it, he took a liking to him.“i just—“ ali opened his eyes again, glancing to see if sangwoo had moved or stopped listening: but he sat, looking at ali with patience. “i miss my son.”sangwoo’s head tilted, a subtle movement of surprise. he supposed he’d just assumed he had no children. “you have a son?”“yeah. a one year old boy.” ali smiled with a soft voice, and if either of the men felt the longing in his eyes, they didn’t mention it. “i had him with my wife, before she died.”sangwoo was still for a bit, before he nodded, turning his head back forwards. “is he why you’re here?”“partly, yes.” ali answered. he shoved his sleeve against his eyes, just to rub something away and drop his arm again.“i’m sorry.” sangwoo murmured. ali shook his head insistently, his eyebrows furrowing as he cleared his throat.“it’s not your fault, sir.” his voice broke and his attempts to hold back to tears were futile. sangwoo felt a flash of sympathy, frowning. “i’m sorry, i’m acting stupid.”sangwoo was looking at him now, glancing to the floor ever so often. he needed to find a way to help ali.sangwoo wasn’t good with this, with emotions. he barely blinked when everybody started to cry for their life, when the people desperately wanted escape. but now, ali took up his entire attention.the korean put a gentle hand on ali’s shoulder, pulling him near. their shoulders touched, side by side, and ali stilled. “you’re not being stupid, ali.”“s— sir?”ali seemed to be confused— sangwoo could guess why. the man always seemed to show a large amount a respect to everybody around him, he acted as if everybody had a higher authority than he. so it was a bit unusual to have the same person casually pull him in for comforting affection.“i can’t act like i understand your situation. but i am sorry for you.” sangwoo spoke lowly. the other gave a little bit of a smile— it was only barely, but sangwoo saw it as progress.“i, i didn’t want to come back to the game.” ali admitted. #218 had a face of question. tears slipped down the man’s face, looking down in embarrassment. “but i needed the money so badly.”sangwoo breathed, slowly moving his hand from ali’s shoulder to his curled hair. ali looked at him. “i’m sure it’s the same for most.”ali paused, and then nodded. a shaky inhale was heard, and he wiped his eyes a again. there were disturbed tear tracks on his face. sangwoo only just realized how much he hated seeing ali cry.“i mean— i mean no disrespect,” ali shifted in almost shame. “but, why are you being so nice to me, sir?”sangwoo looked down at him then. his hand brushed through his hair calmly, as if it was natural, as if he’d been doing it for years. “you deserve it.”ali’s eyes met his, and he looked down again. he finally seemed to accept it, leaning his head down onto sangwoo’s shoulder. sangwoo smiled. what a poor thing.“i will die in here. i just hope my son has a good life.” ali seemed so sure of the fact, that he was lose. it made sangwoo frown once more. “i can hope.”sangwoo’s hand continued to brush through the man’s hair, a peaceful gesture. a sad whine escaped ali’s throat, and sangwoo lowered his face to #199’s hair.“i will do everything i can to make sure we both get out of here.” he said. and if even if he couldn’t, he would try. ali choked back another whine, and sangwoo wiped the tears dripping down his face. “it’s okay, ali.”ali moved his head, so his face rested on the male’s shoulder. he nudged him with his nose in thanks, and sangwoo smiled. it looked unnatural on the otherwise stonefaced business man, but he smiled.“thank you, sir.” the pakistani sniffled. the other nodded, and he gave a kiss to ali’s hair. the other raised his head in response; through the dim light, he could barely see ali’s face flush. sangwoo’s eyes glimmered with delicate amusement.“i care for you, ali.”ali fiddled with his jacket’s sleeve, letting out a small hiccup as a result of the crying. “i’m,— i don’t understand why, but thank you very much.”sangwoo’s eyes stayed on him, head still tilted minorly. he breathed in and out. it appeared he was thinking. ali blinked inquisitively.“sir?”ali was met with a smile, a hand going to rest on his cheek. sangwoo felt the stubble scratch his palm. ali’s face was thinly veiled with curiosity, if not confusion— sangwoo thought it was cute, warming, even.ali didn’t pull the hand away. he seemed to enjoy the warmth of the limb. and sangwoo, he leaned in.their lips touched hesitantly, sangwoo waited for the moment ali pushed him away in panic.but, in the moment of a miracle, it never came.he felt ali still, surprise filling the man. his rough stubble created friction, but sangwoo was too smitten to really notice.ali eventually melted into the kiss, a final whine rising in his mouth. sangwoo smiled and pushed his lips against the man more. his hand slowly went to the nape of his neck, and he felt the start of the dark black hair. the other hand reached for ali’s shoulder.the kiss was warm and somehow reassuring. they separated only to breathe, and their foreheads touched.“sir..” ali said in a whisper, to not break the fragile silence. sangwoo shushed him with care, pulling back to look.“i am sorry you got in this mess in the first place.” sangwoo mumbled with a flat voice, but ali could see that he meant it. #218 gingerly took one of his hands and placed it on ali’s.“i was the one who put myself in this. you shouldn’t apologize for that.” ali searched for the right words, pausing and stumbling over words. there was silence again, until, “why did you kiss me, sir?”“you can call me sangwoo, you know.” he chuckled softly, but went to answer the initial question. he looked into ali’s eyes. “i care for you, as i said.”ali’s eyes glimmered, and he leaned his head onto sangwoo’s chest. sangwoo welcomed it, putting his free hand in ali’s curls.“mm, i thank you, sangwoo.” ali thanked with a unsure tone, saying the man’s name with hesitance.sangwoo slipped his eyes closed, holding ali close to his heart. “of course, ali.”"
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34199386,Stressed.,taiglow,"with tired eyes, you scanned the large room through the small gaps provided with the bed boards and mattresses that surrounded you. this was so… childlike. it definitely reminded you of something you’d do as a young kid. ironic; all of the games that you’ve played so far have all brought you back to your childhood. red light, green light. dalgona. tug of rope. the blackout and the forts. what was this all even about? were these hidden messages? no… probably not. you’re reading way too into it.you bring your head down for a short moment to recall the decisions you’ve made over the past few days. not only were you given the chance to go home after that shoot out in the red light, green light game but you came back to play more. what was worth your life that much? money. it’s always been money. to survive, to live, for everything really. you’ve also made allies, which is incredibly good for a place like this. having people to support you while you support them back is a good price to pay.your thoughts have gotten more overwhelming over the past few days that you’ve been here. death. if you lose a game, you’re dead. there’s no way out of it… and you agreed to it. but did you really? sure, you signed the paper but was this really out of your free will? people are really dying over the millions and billions of dollars that could be provided to them if they win. just the night before the lights went out and people were running around trying to find a way to survive. then the old man started yelling, to which the lights were turned back on and the chaos diminished. it’s good to have him on the team, the shape faced bastards probably pity him.it isn’t too hard to get out of your brainnumbing trance at this point, especially when it’s a hand pressing up against your shoulder. you had almost forgot that one of your allies, sangwoo cho, had stayed up with your to be on guard for the first half of the night. “y/n… you seem stressed.” sangwoo’s voice was low, he had no intentions of waking up the others from their well deserved slumber. he analyzed your movements before actually interfering. you were slouched over with your head down, it seemed as though you were sleeping. but your eyes were open. sangwoo could only conclude that you were thinking about everything that had gone down. who wouldn’t?abruptly, you sit up correctly, putting your hand behind you to support your body weight. “no… no, sangwoo, i’m fine.” you respond, bringing up a hand to rub over one of your temples. you realize he doesn’t believe you when you take a look at him, his brow is raised slightly and his eyes are scanning over your features. “i said i’m fine.” you reassure him, to which he allows his hand to drop from your shoulder and back onto his own lap.you were tempted to ask him why he was here, what situation he was in for him to so desperately want the money as much as everyone in this damn place. though, maybe that question was a little too evasive. maybe tomorrow. that is, if you both make it through the next game. “how about you get some rest? i can watch for the both of us.” sangwoo suggests, pushing his glasses further up the bridge of his nose as they had slightly gone down.surprised? no, not really. you felt so out of it and he could totally see that. maybe you should sleep… “no. i’ll be okay. i’m just a little on edge, that’s all.” you finally crack, shifting your body to more so face him rather than the gaps you should be looking through. sangwoo notices this, he slightly moves over towards you so that his knee, which is in crisscross form, is now touching your thigh. you didn’t say anything, but the sudden contact felt nice. sangwoo was a very attractive man, the stubble on his face was beginning to grow in. when he first came in he was clean and shaven, almost as if he was coming in for an interview. though now, his hair is slightly tattered and his jumpsuit has small splotches of blood on it. and yet…“are you sure? i don’t mind.” sangwoo insists, to which you don’t respond to. you’ll be fine for the rest of the duration that you have to be awake for, for when you have to wake up gihun and the older man to watch the second half of the night. you feel warmth slowly draping you, more specifically your waist. sangwoo leans in so that his lips are close to your ear, they almost touched. “i could help you with your stress.” this definitely wasn’t something sangwoo would do out in the real world, casually have sex with someone just for the hell of it wasn’t in his radar. though in here, with the days going by faster and the risk of dying exploding exponentially, he wouldn’t mind having his cock buried in a beautiful woman’s cunt.you could pull his arm away or even slap him for suggesting such a ludicrous idea. especially in the situation and area you’re stuck in. though, his offer was tempting, you didn’t really plan on turning him down. maybe he could help you with your stress. “i wouldn’t mind…” you say, bringing a hand up to place it on his chest. when you’re hand makes contact with the fabric of his shirt, sangwoo pulls you up so that you’re now positioned on his lap. he seemed to be hungry for this too. your knee is brushing up against his crotch, which reacts perfectly by rising against his sweatpants. he allows a small grunt to pass his lips, probably the only sound he’ll make to conceal the fact that he would be fucking an ally right in front of the rest of his sleeping allies.no time is wasted, as you immediately pull your own sweatpants down so that you’re just in your underwear and the zipper sweater that you’ve been provided with. sangwoo does the same, he does it pretty swiftly as well. your covered pussy lips are now pressing on his lean thigh, a shiver runs down your spine at the sudden connection. “ride it.” he says, his boxers getting tighter as he says those words. ride his thigh? you curiously moved your hips, swaying them forward before dragging your body back on his thigh. at first, you didn’t understand the appeal for him. for you, it would be the fabric of your underwear as well as the pressure from his thigh that would get you off. maybe it was the fact that your knee would brush against his balls as you moved? or maybe he wanted to see your face when you cum?you move your hips just a tiny bit faster, your clit is starting to get stimulated and you so desperately want to take your panties off. you attempted to take them off, but sangwoo stops you. his eyes are behind his glasses and littered with lust. “keep them on… i’ll take them off myself.” he says, almost as if it’s a demand. though you don’t protest, as you can barley hear his words due to how quiet he’s being. sangwoo brings his hands down to your semibare ass, taking two handfuls to help guide you on his thigh. his strong arms begin to move your body back and forth on his leg. your voice hitches when you feel more contact on your clit, the hand on his chest begins to ball up. you push your face into his neck to stop the noises that want to come out.“please.” are the only words you can manage to say as you continue to move your cunt on his thigh. you’re desperate, and he knows it. he lifts his leg slightly so that the heel of his foot is now planted on the floor, and with that he begins to bounce his leg to help you. it doesn’t take long to have your vision be overpowered with white and your pussy to be painfully pulsating around nothing. fingers, cock, something, you needed to get the irritating itch off. “let me… let me use your dick now.” you say against his neck, pulling your face away so that you’re now facing him. his ears are visibly red and so are his cheeks, which says a lot since you’re both in such a dark room. was he embarrassed?“i said i’d help you with your stress.” sangwoo states, releasing your ass and placing his hands on the small of your back. he emphasizes the “your” in his sentence. in all honesty, sangwoo wasn’t expecting to have gotten this far. if he had to jerk himself off after this, he didn’t mind. though, you have offered him a way to release his own load. did he really want to deny the opportunity? his cock is swelling, and he couldn’t even imagine how it would look if he pulled his boxers off. though, before he can protest any further, your hand is pressing up against his shaft. sangwoo releases a hiss, his body jerking up to feel more of your hand. you can’t help but allow your lip to curve slightly.with gentle hands, you reach for his waist band and pull down slightly. sangwoo helps you take his own boxers off, and you get off of his thigh to get better access. his dick is pressing up against his own stomach, a wet substance has began to drip from the tip of it. the veins were also protruding, you wanted to take it all in. was he really this needy? just as needy as you? your pussy is still throbbing, and definitely still lubricated with your gooey cum. as a way to accept the offer, he reaches to pull your panties down to your knees. he doesn’t stop you when he sees you lift your body, put his cock in your hands, and guides his dick into your entrance. you try not to engulf him completely, so you accept just the tip. sangwoo’s lip twitches, and he desperately thrusts up into you. you loose your balance and control as your hand immediately slaps over your own mouth to restrain you from making noises. though with this, you’ve fallen down to your knees completely and have taken his whole cock inside of you.you attempt to regain your composure, but sangwoo doesn’t take any second for you do fulfill that objective. with his hands, he’s lifted you slightly so that you’re positioned higher than you normally would have been and begins to thrust into you. you’re mewling, not even the sounds of the soft clap your bodies make when they come into contact can cover the moans you’re making. “y/n… quiet.” he says, putting his face into the bare skin of your neck. he gently sucks on the flesh, surely it would bruise. the man’s glasses are beginning to fall down the bridge of his nose again and his hair is slowly sweeping over his eyes. sangwoo continues to drill his cock into your pussy, your eyes begin to prick with tears. you had orgasmed not even a few minutes ago and here you were again, just a get thrusts into an another orgasm. his thumbs gently brush over your skin as they continue to hold your waist.the man didn’t realize how tight you would be, and how wet you’d be either. the way you tightened around him got him closer to the edge of his own load. sangwoo let’s out a soft moan against your neck, his lips are slowly parting as he’s now beginning to hyper focus on his own cock. the squelching sounds your pussy makes aren’t loud but are just enough for him to hear. he loves the mixture of the lewd sounds coming out of your mouth along with the sounds both of your sexes are making. “fuck, y/n.” he grunts, continuing to thrust into you as you have now began to move your own body in sync with his, only intensifying your sensitive hole. as your orgasm begins to approach again, you begin to bounce on his dick a lot faster than you intended. a short “ahhhh” rushes past your lips when you cum again, this time you’ve done it on his cock.when your pussy begins to spasm, sangwoo shortly follows right after due to the constraining feeling you put him through with your hole tightening. he yelps slightly, the grasp he has on your waist tightens as his balls clench and he cums. you feel the hot ropes shoot inside of you, he thrusts a few more times to ride out his own high. when you lift your body off his cock, you feel his cum drip from your gaping hole onto his bare thigh. your slick and his cum are all over his dick, he must have had some pent up stressed too.”thank you.” sangwoo pants, his lips are still parted while he looks at you. sweat is tickling down the back of his neck and he’s out of breath. your own lips gently brush against his, giving the man a kiss. sangwoo doesn’t expect it, but he allows himself to kiss you back. his face turns hot again once he realizes what the two of you just did. “now… you get some rest. i’ll stay up to watch.” he says, knowing damn well that once you fall asleep he would touch himself and replay the experience."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34432015,First Class,Duni,"“final call, the flight will be leaving in 5 minutes!”the echo of the intercom illuminated the halls into the wait room. seong gihun sat in thought, his grip clenched around his briefcase while his free hand focused on fumbling with the handle on his suitcase. it felt weird in his hands, he’d never actually used one before for years, he’d always been in one place never imagining or dreaming of leaving.yet it was time, he was finally going to be a father to his only daughter. he had his things packed and ready to board the airplane, ready to go to the new world and grow from there.he’d miss korea obviously, but he’d be coming back soon enough. he had one goal this time and it was to find his daughter and at least attempt to rekindle their relationship somehow.he was nervous though, much more than a grown man of his age should be. not for what you’d think  he’s just a nervous flyer. he couldn’t stop his knee from bouncing through the adrenaline or the tips of his fingers dancing on his thigh. he had all the typical “whatifs” lined up incase of any emergency.except his mind was clouded by the other “whatifs” instead of the “what if i’m late to my flight?”the voice on the intercom quickly took his attention back as he grabbed his supplies and made a run for it towards the plane. already shoving out breaths, using all the energy he could muster up that morning. yet that all came to a halt when he was greeted by a shut door.“the flight is now closed, thank you for choosing our airline!”gihun stared in astonishment at the red sign in front of him, his cases both hanging awkwardly from his hands. “fuck,” he drooped his head to look at the ground.“excuse me, sir. do you need a new flight time?” a nice lady looked at him with concern, clearly noticing just how anxious he looked.gihun thought for a moment, his teeth chattering ever so slightly at the thought sound of the plane shooting off into the sky. “that won’t be necessary, i’ll...i’ll take a look over here.” gihun let out a quick cough to fill the silence and lifted his head before walking over to the chairs and plopping down. the lady only watched with a sad smile before returning her attention to her work.gihun let out a husky groan and planted his face between each of his palms to rub profusely.“miss your flight?” a stoic voice came from the side, making him pause his hands. “must’ve been an important one.” the voice continued, but gihun only pressed his lips together as the guilt settled in. it was an important one, he was right. this guy really had nice analyzing skills, not like he didn’t already look like his life was in shambles.he had been so prepared this morning too, all for it to go to waste in a matter of minutes.“what was it? business? vacation? no,” he gestured to the briefcase gihun had sitting beside his ankle. “family? new life?” he continued listing off ideas, his own sarcastic tone only rubbing in the guilt that gihun was feeling.“new life,” gihun mumbled to interrupt the ongoing list. who was this guy? why was he trying so hard to rub salt into wound?better yet, he hadn’t even taken a look at the guy, all he could hear was his antagonizing voice. he probably wasn’t even gihun’s shoulders dropped even further than he thought they could once his eyes landed right on the man beside him. and his smirk.he was handsome, sure, but he couldn’t shake just how cocky that smirk was. did he like seeing gihun like this? devastated? who cares if he had good looks, he wouldn’t take this type of treatment from a stranger sitting next to him. he only huffed out a breath of air before moving away from the man one seat over. he scooted across two seats before slumping onto his knees again.“where were you going?” the man pointed to his cases, the smirk still present on his face. “the us?” he tapped his finger against his chin, looking around for any type of yes or no.“the us, yeah,” gihun said quietly out of annoyance, but the man’s voice suddenly was closer and more clear than before.it was then that as soon as he lifted his head, he was met by two dark eyes hiding behind fitted glasses. he could feel his face heating up with embarrassment as those eyes stared deep into his soul. accompanied by the smirk, of course.gihun was frozen as the man leaned across him to pick up the name tag hanging from his case. “seong...gihun,” the voice read, dropping the name tag.“cho sangwoo,” he held out his hand, way too calmly for gihun’s taste.his face twisted into confusion as he gave the man a quick handshake, moving his hand right back into his lap. “do you need something? you seem very...” gihun looked the man up and down, regretting it immediately as he saw just how fitted and tall this man was. “...persistent...” he trailed off, his eyes landing on the tight business pants that hugged sangwoo’s lap perfectly.“do i? i guess you could say that...” his eyes followed gihun’s, his smirk quickly returning. “you could say that fits me well.” this caused gihun to flinch ever so slightly and lift his eyes back up to meet sangwoo’s.who the hell was this guy? this is not what he was expecting to run into when he decided to book a flight today. and why was this guy so persistent? was this some kind of mugging scheme?the thought made gihun instinctively rub his pockets to make sure his wallet was still there. he couldn’t risk getting mugged again just like a couple days ago.sangwoo was amused by this movement, causing him to straighten up and give the man some space. “you’re very cautious, i didn’t mean to offend you.” he fixed his glasses and calmly placed his palms on the chair. he was curious though, the man was quite entertainingly adorable. he wish he’d smile, though. he was sure it’d be even cuter.“no...no you didn’t offend me, i’m just confused on why you’re...doing this.” he gestured to sangwoo, clear confusion in his eyes. “did i do something or is this a public experiment or...” gihun couldn’t wrap his head around some stranger, let alone a handsome stranger, coming up to him to just start talking.“ah,” sangwoo interlocked his hands together and nodded his head towards gihun, who in return turned to stare at him with curiosity. “i have to admit, i tend to just ‘go for it’ when i see something i want er, take an interest in.” sangwoo spoke eloquently, never keeping his eyes away from gihun’s entranced look. hooked.“i truly didn’t intend any harm, i’ll move back to where i was if it’d make you feel more comfortable,” he let out a hurt sigh, feigning a look of disdain present on his face. gihun scrambled momentarily as he watched sangwoo lift himself and grab his items.“wait,” gihun spoke, a redness forming on his cheeks, shocked by his sudden words. “i mean you don’t have to go if you don’t...want to.” this was embarrassing, why did he care that much? at this point just let the man do what he wants.sangwoo looked at him with amusement, taking an equal amount of slowness to come back to the chair and place himself beside gihun, closer than before.what a sweet, pure thing. so innocent, so cautious.like a rabbit, hiding from its prey.sangwoo sighed, pleased with how this interaction was going. he looked at the time on his watch, his flight was close but he didn’t want to leave this one just yet. it seemed just perfect enough that they both had the idea of visiting the us.“are you going to change your flight time?” he asked curiously, a honeysoaked voice coaxing gihun. “perhaps we could ride the same,” he offered, showing gihun the time on his ticket.as he looked over sangwoo’s ticket, his shoulders dropped once more. first class. of course this guy had money, he had the look to go along with it perfectly. “ah...first class,” he smiled weakly at the man, awkwardness dripping from his lips. “i couldn’t afford that,” he shook his head and handed the ticket back.sangwoo watched in amusement, his hand suddenly lifting to rest on gihun’s head. “wha,” gihun stumbled over his words, the feeling of the large hand looming over his head comfortably.“stay here,” sangwoo let out a sigh, lifting himself from the chair to visit the front desk. gihun only watched in curiosity before he returned minutes later with a sly smile.a ticket was handed to him, instantly causing him to stare at sangwoo with worried eyes. “oh no, no. i can’t pay this back, i do they accept refunds?” gihun was worried, his eyebrows furrowed with sudden anxiousness. who the hell...was..this guy?“you don’t have to pay me back with money,” sangwoo whispered, leaning forward as the tip of his finger gently slid underneath gihun’s chin. the bright puppy dog eyes stared into sangwoo with curiosity and the want to please. it made a shiver of excitement slide down sangwoo’s back.“what can i do? do you know anyone who needs a worker? i can do fulltime to pay it off, just let me know. i can give you some gift cards i have collected,” before gihun could reach for his wallet, sangwoo grabbed his wrist and lifted it slowly.“i said i don’t need money,” his voice was stern, cutting right into gihun’s ears. “i want...something else,” he trailed off, his eyes drifting to the side to feign a thought. gihun listened earnestly as he watched sangwoo. he was ready to do anything, he had already felt terrible about missing the first flight, he had to do something.subtly, sangwoo was checking the time on his watch. they had just a bit longer, just enough time to fully reel in the man beside him.“follow me, leave your stuff here. it will be safe, trust me.” sangwoo reassured him, gently lifting his wrist to encourage him to follow. expectedly, gihun followed without question.the bathroom door was shoved open by sangwoo before he pulled gihun in a locked the doors. it was empty, quiet, cold.it needed just a bit of heat. which they would provide of course.“now,” sangwoo had his back to gihun, unbuttoning the cuffs on his shirt. “take off your clothes,” he said nonchalantly, causing gihun to make a quick sound is astonishment.“excuse..me?” gihun clarified, his eyes wide with confusion. suddenly sangwoo spun around and his shirt was placed comfortably on his arm, his chest overbearing and strong. his face was serious and he stared at gihun with a sneer.sangwoo’s free hand lifted to loosen gihun’s tie himself. “continue, will you?” sangwoo asked kindly, before sliding gihun’s tie off completely. he’d be using this momentarily.gihun was still standing there, frozen by the command this man had given him. he was still unsure of what to do, he hadn’t ever done this before and he certainly wasn’t prepared for it either.he thought back to the ticket, his mind becoming guilty once more.he was handsome...it wouldn’t be that bad, he was paying off debt and that’s one less thing he had to worry about. gihun stared curiously, watching sangwoo actively undressing. he was tan, strong...gihun was shocked by the feeling he was suddenly growing in his own pants. how the hell...“what did i say?” sangwoo was staring at him, fully submerged from his clothes. gihun’s eyes dropped once more to look at the throbbing area sangwoo wore proudly. “i said,” he leaned forward to press gihun against the wall. “finish taking off your clothes.” a growl followed his words before he let go of gihun, his attention now fully on him.suddenly gihun’s hands just began moving on their own, unbuttoning and tearing away whatever clothes he had on. after every layer he would simply let them drop to the ground, trying his best not to look at the man in front of him, despite the way he could feel eyes on him. like a hungry predator staring right at its prey.when the final layer of clothing hit the ground, sangwoo lunged forward to press gihun against the sink. “look at you,” he mumbled, his hands pinning gihun’s to the edge of the sink while his hips pinned him harder. “the moment i laid eyes on you,” sangwoo’s voice was muffled by gihun’s thick hair, a thick chuckle following. “so many things went through my head...” he sighed before pulling his face away from the soft area. gihun could only stand there, numerous thoughts going through his head. he wasn’t sure whether to feel terrified or horrifically turned on. seemingly both was the answer.sangwoo was pressing hard against gihun’s hips, their dicks shoved and moved together with each movement. soft moans slipped through gihun’s lips, shocking himself at how unconscious they were. before he could comprehend it, sangwoo had scooped up one of gihun’s thighs and held is tightly. “you fit me perfectly, i can already tell,” he reassured, massaging the tender skin.gihun was already squirming slightly, but the heavy weight of the man in front of him kept him stable against the sink. the pressure was immense yet it only made his dick throb more. his eyes dropped to look down at the way they pressed, the redness between them both making a warmer moan push passed his lips. the raw image of it all made gihun’s head tilt back and hit the mirror behind them. a perfect view for sangwoo to watch.sangwoo watched himself in the mirror as he grabbed his dick, sliding it down gihun’s propped thigh. the ohsofamiliar smirk returning once he watched his pupils dilate as soon as the head of his dick slid across gihun’s ass. he could already tell just how tight gihun was, he craved the feeling almost instantly.well, he had some mercy at least.sangwoo let go of his dick as it rubbed across gihun’s. they both moaned simultaneously at the feeling. “what’re you...” gihun trailed off breathlessly as he watched sangwoo spit into his hand and rub the saliva between his fingers. he suddenly let out a weakened cry as sangwoo shoved two fingers into gihun’s ass. “shit, shit that hurts,” he whimpered, his ass subconsciously clenching in response to the foreign feeling.“relax,” sangwoo grunted as he started moving his fingers in a deep, thrusting rate. at the same time, sangwoo began rubbing their dicks against each other, causing more deep moans to fill the bathroom. as gihun became distracted by the hypersensitivity on his dick, sangwoo was scissoring, stretching and rubbing for the moment gihun could no longer keep himself up. he’d find it, he always did.it wasn’t seconds later before gihun’s knees were shaking, the shocking signal sliding up to his dick after each time sangwoo pressed and rubbed against the one sensitive spot. at this moment, sangwoo lifted gihun’s other leg so that he completely sat on the edge of the sink. “if you if you keep doing that“ gihun’s breath shook, his toes curling with every movement. “i’m gonna““no.” sangwoo stopped his fingers instantly and pulled them out with one swift motion. the feeling made a strangled wine slip out of gihun. their dicks were still sliding against each other, each one throbbing at their own rate. “you’re going to take it all before you cum,” he growled, grabbing his dick and placing it back to where he was before.“sangw“ gihun gasped sharply as sangwoo’s dick was instantly shoved into gihun’s ass. tightness squeezed his dick perfectly.sangwoo was pleased with himself, this would probably be the best orgasm he’d get this week. he’d caught the perfect one.“i feel very“ gihun gulped, almost to try to ground himself from this pain and new sensation. “i feel full, all over,” he breathed haggardly, one hand lifting to grip sangwoo’s shoulder. it almost wasn’t enough as sangwoo’s hips were shoving in and out of his ass, the tightness making each thrust longer and deeper. gihun was squeezing every single inch of sangwoo’s dick and he loved it.for such a cautious, unorganized man, he certainly was skilled at taking dick. sangwoo’s dick to be specific. not only that, but those sweet angelic moans that were pouring out of him was music to his ears. and he loved being the cause of them.it had only been minutes before gihun was pleading at the feeling, loving the way sangwoo hit inside him perfectly. “sangwoo,” gihun pleaded as he melted against the sink, using the mirror to prop up his head the best he could. “keep doingthat“ gihun pressed against sangwoo’s thrusts, trying to soak up every sensation he got.his pretty dick was already spewing small bits of precum. sangwoo’s head was tilted back slightly, taking in the noises and the feelings of every thrust he delivered into gihun. “you like that, don’t you? weren’t aware of just how much you loved dick, were you?” sangwoo mumbled between breaths and thrusts as he raised his hand to press against gihun’s throat.all gihun could do was give a long, pitiful, choked whine in response, his ankles locked around sangwoo’s hips to keep him close. he wanted him deeper, to fill him up completely. the pressure on his throat only made the sensitive pressure increase. he was right, he’d never thought of being with another man, but after this he may consider it to be one of his favorites. this certainly would change his outlook on life a bit.suddenly, on the brink of cumming, gihun started pumping his dick with quick movements to escalate his orgasm even further. “i’m gonna i’m“ gihun yelled out the best he could with his choked breath, his hand moving at a quicker pace before sheets of white cum spewed into the air. with each pump and throb, a new string slipped out with a whimpering moan to follow.as soon as sangwoo heard the whiney moans coming from the pitiful thing below him, his own dick was squeezed hard enough to cum directly inside of gihun. it was constant, throbs of pleasure that filled gihun up completely that day.moments passed before sangwoo slid out of gihun with ease.sangwoo had his clothes on as soon as possible, standing to see the limp man in front of him. “get dressed. unlike you, i don’t like to miss my airline flights.” sangwoo checked his watch for the time once more. right on time.gihun hesitantly brought himself off of the sink to slide his clothes back on. everything ached but he wouldn’t be able to shake loose the thought of how that orgasm felt. unlike anything he’d ever felt before.they both exited the bathroom and gihun was surprised to see their cases resting just as they had before they left. perhaps sangwoo was serious when he said they didn’t need to worry.as they walked to their flight, sangwoo’s hand gripped possessively over gihun’s hips. he...kind of liked that feeling.—first class was vastly different than what they passed. it had drinks, nice seating, everything gihun would not have been able to afford. it brought sparkles to his eyes as he looked around, it seemed lonely almost.once sangwoo found his seat, it was almost instinct for gihun to place himself in the seat beside him. he had almost forgotten just how nervous he was for the plane to take off, but the throbbing feeling in his ass preoccupied his mind almost the entire time.although, the way sangwoo’s hand grabbed his hips and the way gihun laid his head on his shoulder made him sleep through the entire ride.perhaps he now had two goals when he reached the us."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34426993,i try to do the best i can (i know you try to do the same),ChuganiiMogi,"it was really just a normal outing with friends.saebyeok and jiyeong had been dating for a little over four years, and saebyeok had just come back from a visit to her family in time for their anniversary. gihun absolutelyinsistedthat they all went out for a round of drinks at the new gay club that had opened up a little ways away, promising to pay for all their rounds in celebration of their anniversary. jiyeong would really never pass up the chance to dress up and go out to town, especially if it meant getting free drinks while they were at it.it didn’t certainly didn’t hurt that dressing up came with the perks of saebyeok’s eyes wandering and staring at everything that jiyeong’s outfits had to offer. maybe she’d even attract some people at that club that would have saebyeok’s hands staying protectively on her body at all times. jiyeong bit her lip just thinking about it as she pulled on her outfit, a simple black crop top exposing the better part of her abdomen with black skinny jeans. simple was better than overcomplicated, afterall. it was the small details that usually sold any look. the exposed skin of her abdomen easily revealed a tattoo that peeked just above the hem of her jeans, in fancy lettering with the numbers,240,engraved into her skin.if anybody knew them, saebyeok had a matching,067, that was tattooed into her own skin, as did gihun with his own number, and so on and so forth. it was reminiscent of their times in the games, a secret shared between only them as the walls around them collapsed during the marble game, just when the gun was pointed at jiyeong’s head and she could see the shaking tremors of saebyeok’s hands. jiyeong let out a sigh, shaking away the memories from her mind, instead focusing on looking hot and celebrating her and saebyeok’s anniversary.she touched up her makeup with a hum, closing her compact mirror and snorting as arms wrapped around her waist and saebyeok nosed at her neck. “what are you doing there?” jiyeong teased, as saebyeok let out a large sigh.the taller girl wore mostly matching clothing with jiyeong, but instead had a black buttonup on and simple black slacks, sleeves cuffed and just above her wrist to reveal the tattoo of a simple circle, which had a couple of meanings that saebyeok was proud about when choosing the tattoo. a marble, the shape of the dalgona she had chosen during the games, and  while saebyeok refused to admit it  the meaning of infinity in the form of a never ending shape.“i told you we should just stay in,” saebyeok grunted, sounding tired, leaning forward and pressing all of her weight into jiyeong’s back. jiyeong was practically pinned to the table that she had been standing in front of due to the mirror helping her see her reflection, before saebyeok slid one of her hands over and opening one of the drawers in front of them. jiyeong’s eyes followed the movement with a raised eyebrow, watching as a familiar, thin black strip of fabric was pulled out, a metal chain to hold it in place on one end and the clip on the other end.so this was what saebyeok was getting at. after a couple of years and endless conversations to communicate properly with each other,  to break each other’s walls and make sure that they could work through past their traumas and doubts and insecurities that stemmed from just more than their relationship formed through a brutal game of death  jiyeong knew that saebyeoklikedknowing that jiyeong was alive and her’s as much as saebyeok had given herself up to jiyeong.and who would have thought that jiyeong, sweet jiyeong who practically grew up in catholic schools due to her jackass of a father, would be into that and much more than willing to play along with the possessive games saebyeok presented for her? jiyeong would have laughed at the irony if she wasn’t focused on the feeling of saebyeok wrapping the choker around her neck snugly. the skin was slowly blossoming red, and jiyeong could already tell where saebyeok’s mind was wandering as the arms around her waist tightened slightly, one of saebyeok’s palms pressing flat against her stomach.trying to brighten up the heavy mood before they became late for their agreed time of meeting, jiyeong turned her head towards saebyeok, pressing her lips to saebyeok’s cheek and blowing raspberry into it. it worked as intended and saebyeok let out a disgusted sound as she backed off, jiyeong laughing in amusement and shaking her head.“no touching untilafter, we’re already going to be late at this point as it is,” jiyeong snorted, already packing her essentials into a black leather purse. saebyeok had scurried to the washroom to wash off jiyeong’s red lipstick and she heard her voice protesting.“if we’re going to be late anyways, what will a few more minutes do?” saebyeok’s muffled voice retorted, before she came out of the washroom, all traces of jiyeong’s lipstick finally gone.“you know that if we started, we’d be much more than ‘a few minutes’ late,” jiyeong rolled her eyes, waiting at the door with her keys in hand, “you’re just looking for an excuse to not go out today, should have done it earlier before we both dressed up if you even wanted a chance.”saebyeok was practically pouting as she finally left the room after a few minutes, even if her face was set into her normally unreadable one, the small purse of her lips was enough to sell it. “whatever, let’s just get going.”“wait.” jiyeong stopped her, placing a hand on saebyeok’s chest, who raised an eyebrow. jiyeong leaned up onto her toes, bringing up a hand to fluff up her hair with a hum, before pressing a chaste kiss to saebyeok’s lips as she finished, holding her hand as she opened the door, “okay, let’s go!”△ ◯ ▢the walk to the club was mostly uneventful, it was close enough that neither felt like it was worth taking their car to drive over, and the calming silence or lazy banter that they partook in while walking was enough for the both of them. they comfortably held each other’s hands, knowing that most passerbys would think nothing of it as they were women, jiyeong knew that even if someone had, neither would care enough to entertain spiteful words and slurs.“you visited cheol and your mother a couple of days ago, how are they?” jiyeong asked, making small conversation as she knew how much saebyeok enjoyed talking about them with her.“they’re doing well,” saebyeok responded, squeezing her hand, “i miss them, but we still can’t take our chances because we don’t know whether i’m safe, or whethershe’ssafe.”“how about cheol? you both decided to put him into schooling right? is he making any new friends there?” jiyeong tried, switching the topic over a little bit as they took a turn into a dark alleyway where the discrete entrance of the club was. they’d address the concerns about safety in private. how saebyeok and jiyeong could easily be tracked if the games ever resurfaced, and how her mother was still struggling from the lasting effects of leaving the north after one year, paranoid that they could be taken back and punished at any moment.“he’s… adjusting,” saebyeok sighed, bringing up a hand to rub at her face, “he doesn’t know what to do and i think it’s freaking him out. i’d help him, but i was never really good in school anyways, even in the north before we had left. never got a proper education between all of the death and trying to escape and it shows.”jiyeong hummed in understanding, intertwining their hands as she pushed open the door to a modestly large place, lights spread around and a body of people already dancing somewhere below. a bar was what instantly greeted them, however, to the right of the large room and on a higher level than the dance floor, where the two instantly spotted some of the others at the bar. gihun and sangwoo were pressed close together on their bar stools, taking shots and looking at each other with heated gazes.it was obvious that they were in the middle of a game, one that would affect the aftermath of the clubbing and jiyeong smirked as they made their way over, saebyeok trailing behind her. ali was awkwardly seated beside them, watching and being the designated driver for the two, she assumed. it certainly didn’t help him that he was the token straight of the group, and had a wife and child to get back home to.minyeo was probably already on the dance floor in the midst of the crowd, which was fitting as the woman couldn’t care less as to who took her home, as long as she was taken home bysomeone.jiyeong couldn’t find it in herself to blame her. who knew how jiyeong would have chosen to cope with the aftermath of their traumatic experiences if she and saebyeok hadn’t found each other.finally reaching the drunk men and ali, jiyeong let out a snarky greeting, “jeez, i don’t feel like watching you two fuck in the middle of a bar, get a room!”gihun drunkenly raised his head with a grin as she stood up, almost falling as he groaned at the bloodrush that instantly came, stumbling towards jiyeong and saebyeok as he slurred his words, “wow!!! if it isn’t the two stars of the evening.”sangwoo’s voice cut through the air as he turned around in his seat, over the loud music that demanded their attention coming from the dance floor below, “you guys are late. we took shots of whiskey every three minutes that you were late. it’s ninethirty. should have come back on time if you ‘didn’t want to watch us fuck’.”jiyeong, in response, immaturely stuck her tongue out at him, smirking as he put up his middle finger at her. sangwoo had much more alcohol tolerance than gihun, but was certainly tipsy and made him much more vulgar than usual. jiyeong always got along better with this version of him.in the amount of time it took for jiyeong to get comfortable, enjoying a conversation with a drunk gihun who was practically clinging onto sangwoo’s arm, saebyeok had already started her own conversation with ali. while the two had talked with each other the least during the games, and even afterwards, an unexpected friendship had budded between them. it was unlikely, but once, between saebyeok and jiyeong,  in the middle of the night as they cuddled in bed  the taller girl had confessed that ali reminded her of her father. at least, the memories of him that she had when she was younger, as her parents had her when they were quite young themselves.ali was thirtyseven now, but maintained a youthful innocence that saebyeok could remember was a source of comfort from her childhood in the north. something that she hadn’t gotten since she was a young child and her father grew older, more focused on keeping them alive rather than catering to saebyeok’s needs as a kid growing up.leaving the two lovebirds alone, jiyeong held a mojito in hand, taking small sips out of the drink and approached the two. ali glanced at her, a seemingly amused grin on his face, before patting saebyeok on the back and going back to sangwoo and gihun with a mildly disgusted face, looking more and more like a babysitter to two old men. she giggled at her own thoughts, and sat beside saebyeok who looked at her with a questioning expression. saebyeok was drinking her own alcoholic beverage, one that ali probably offered up to her in lieu of sangwoo and gihun’s game finishing once they had arrived.“hey, pretty lady,” jiyeong hummed, leaning into saebyeok with a grin, “what are you doing all alone in such a nice club? haven’t gotten picked up by anybody yet?”saebyeok rolled her eyes, but smirked a little nonetheless, and maybe jiyeong was getting a little bit tipsy as she thought about exactly how attractive saebyeok was, a light sheen on sweat coating her skin and colours dancing on her face.“well, i actually think that there was somebody staring at me just a little while ago,” she said, knocking her head against jiyeong’s who raised an eyebrow in surprise.“really now?” jiyeong challenged, and saebyeok gestured her head over somewhere to the right of them. jiyeong leaned forward to get a look, seeing a woman that couldn’tpossiblycompete with her for saebyeok’s attention glancing at the both of them. she scoffed, rolling her eyes with a grin.“yeah, where do you think i got this…” saebyeok paused for a moment, staring at it as she tried to remember the name of the drink, “rainbowvodkafrom?”pretending to gag at the idea, jiyeong said, “eugh, she bought you a rainbow vodka? no wonder she’s alone, with such a shit taste in alcohol.”saebyeok brought a hand up to teasingly smack at the back of jiyeong’s head, who giggled, “yeah, yeah, stop acting like you’re jealous dummy. you know that i only care about you…”saebyeok mumbled that last part, and jiyeong fluttered her eyelashes as she rested on her hands while leaning forwards and crooned at her. “but,darling,” jiyeong drawled, licking her lips and watching as saebyeok’s eyes followed the movement of her tongue with halflidded eyes, “didn’t you learn so long ago that jealous sex is always the best?”she could practically see how saebyeok held her breath, the outline of her throat as saebyeok gulped and the shaking of her lips. jiyeong loved riling her girlfriend up like this, pushing and prodding at her buttons until saebyeok couldn’t take it anymore and took her on the nearest surface that they could without being watched by unwelcome eyes.jiyeong hadn’t pushed saebyeok enough yet, but was already feeling the turn of her stomach and a heat rising in her core. it just occurred to her that the two hadn’t had sex in a couple weeks in between the new job that jiyeong had landed even with her checkered background and saebyeok being stressed about her family that had moved to somewhere in cheongju for safety, and jiyeong was more than ready for that to change.saebyeok turned away for a second, seemingly to compose herself, “i wasnotrejected sex earlier to go to this stupid club, only for us to leave less than an hour after we arrived here.”she started chugging down her vodka, slamming it down on the table in front of them with a large grimace on her face, and jiyeong finished her own. saebyeok turned to her with a determined gaze as they finished, grabbing her hand and forcing them both to get up.“let’s dance!” she exclaimed, and jiyeong raised an eyebrow as her lips turned up and she let herself be dragged along by saebyeok, making her pause for just a moment so that she could hand her purse over to ali, who took it with a nod. she couldn’t help how her head had wandered over to the woman saebyeok told her about while she was pulled towards the dance floor by a tipsy saebyeok.the woman in question was looking at the two of them with wide, surprised eyes and her mouth slightly open. jiyeong made eye contact, and  grinned victoriously at her, not bothering to spare the lonely woman any more of her attention as she looked at the back of saebyeok’s head. the two walked down the stairs, hands intertwined and sweaty in the heat of the room. she grinned at the collective group of bodies dancing with each other, the smell of alcohol and sweat in the air. while many would be repulsed by the whole atmosphere, it was easily a place jiyeong knew that she could fit in, a club full of those that were like her and where her background didn’t matter to those around them, and their backgrounds didn’t matter to her.they made their way somewhere in the midst of the sea of people, saebyeok turning around to face her with a sheepish smile as jiyeong grinned happily with a wide smile. jiyeong brought saebyeok’s hand that was intertwined with hers up to her neck, leaning into the touch and curling two of saebyeok’s fingers underneath her choker, who followed the movements intensely. she then threw her arms around saebyeok’s neck with a coy smile, standing on her toes to press another kiss onto her lips and pressing her face into saebyeok’s neck, one of saebyeok’s hands moving yet again to rest on the exposed skin of her abdomen, possessively pressing against the area she knew jiyeong’s tattoo was engraved into.jiyeong hummed to the melody of the song, hips swaying smoothly as saebyeok’s breath huffed against the shell of her ear, the fingers looped into her choker pulling against it. she let out a gasp as it tightened around her neck, the hot sensation curling tighter in her stomach. her thighs were getting slick, and she could feel her own breath hitching as her face reddened in arousal. saebyeok’s free hand had started roaming, blunt nails scraping against the hem of her jeans and teasingly scratching at the skin just underneath the denim material.she groaned directly into saebyeok’s ear who grunted in response, testing boundaries as she then unlooped her fingers from the choker and bringing the hand down to possessively squeeze at jiyeong’s ass while her other continued to tease at the expanse of jiyeong’s skin.“saebyeok,” jiyeong said into her ear, just loud enough for saebyeok to hear her over the music, her eyes closing as she licked her lips. “you… did you think about me while you were visiting cheol and your mother at night? touch yourself to the thought of me?”she felt saebyeok squeeze at her skin again, dragging a hot path from the side of her waist to the small of her back, “every night. well i couldn’t… touch myself every night i was gone, but i thought of you a lot before sleeping.”jiyeong hummed, encouraging her to go on as one of her hands scratched at the nape of her neck, her fingers brushing through the baby hairs that had grown there. “sometimes i thought about kissing you until you were desperate for me to touch your cunt,” saebyeok confessed, her voice raspy and deeper than usual.a wet heat pooled between her legs as saebyeok continued, “sometimes… sometimes i thought about you underneath me and sometimes i was eating you out. other times i was fingering you while you were crying…”jiyeong’s breath hitched as she waited for the next confession that was told to her. her arms tightening around saebyeok’s neck trying to pull her closer than they already were.“sometimes i thought about railing you while you were crying and begging me to stop because you just came way too many times in a row,” saebyeok whispers the confession into her ear, hot and heavy, before pulling back. jiyeong shuddered, and in the colourful arrays of light shining on their faces in the dark, the two gazed into each other’s halflidded eyes, short breaths hitting each other’s lips.“then make it come true.” jiyeong replied, relishing in the feeling of the hands tightening on her waist, saebyeok’s short nails digging into her skin, just underneath the hem of her crop top.suddenly, the two were moving again, saebyeok pulling her towards the stairs as jiyeong let out a couple of deep breaths with blownout eyes. fuck. she was so wet it was almost unbearable. the two definitely weren’t about to go home, too pent up and desperate for each other to make the walk home. jiyeong knew that were would definitely be much more to come at home, in their bed, however, and the two barely paid attention to gihun’s whistle as they passed the trio of men, walking towards one of the many genderneutral restrooms that were lined up in a neat row. a couple were already taken, but jiyeong and saebyeok finally found one that was open, stumbling into it as their lips pressed together roughly, slamming and locking the door behind them.it was cleaner than either of them expected as the club was new, but they were used to dirt and grime after growing up around it, so it wouldn’t have bothered them either way. saebyeok pushed jiyeong towards the sink, lifting her up to sit down and jiyeong’s legs wrapped around her waist, feeling a bulge against her that definitely wasn’t there when saebyeok had pinned her against the desk earlier.blearily, she tried to remember when exactly saebyeok had the time to pull the strap on inbetween the small space of time and noted how saebyeok did only come out of their room a couple minutes after jiyeong had.smart.she had no time to dwell on it, probably would have joked about saebyeok’s speed if she wasn’t letting out small moans of delight as saebyeok grinded against her with a hiss. everything felt heavy, her clothes restricting her as she whimpered.“saebyeok, come on,” jiyeong huffed, her hands desperately pulling at saebyeok’s blouse before she was stopped, hands being roughly pinned against the mirror behind her and she arched her back, struggling against them, “weren’t you the one saying you’d rail me until i was crying and begging you to stop? hurry up!”saebyeok let out a dark sound, laving her tongue against jiyeong’s neck and biting roughly at the skin, “i’ll fuck you when i want to fuck you, don’tpushme.”“fuck you,” jiyeong gasped, tears already pricking at the corner of her eyes when saebyeok bit at her collar roughly for her lack of manners, “maybe i’ll find someone myself fuck me out there then, someone who’ll actually give me what i want.”the two enjoyed playing these games, when tensions were so winded up that they snapped, contesting and pushing each other as much as possible until anything other than the thought ofmore, more, more.had been pushed out of their minds.saebyeok brought a hand down to squeeze jiyeong’s face in her palm, nose flared as the two intensely stared at each other, “we both know that they’d never be able to even make you come because iruinedyou for anybody else. reconsider your words before you’re crying and sobbing and running back to me because you couldn’t come while they fucked you.”jiyeong grit her teeth but said nothing, panting as saebyeok let go of her face roughly, the hand moving down to push her top and her bra up above her breasts. she threw her head back, groaning as saebyeok took a nipple into her mouth, the wet heat of her tongue circling around the bud. she didn’t notice how saebyeok undid the button of her jeans and unzipped it until the taller girl pulled away. saebyeok pulled jiyeong’s jeans and knickers to bunch up around her feet and rested jiyeong’s calves on her shoulders before undoing her own slacks.jiyeong let out a stuttering breath as she stared at the wellendowed, black dildo hungrily, biting her lip. saebyeok stared at her for a moment as jiyeong didn’t look away from the strapon, one hand still holding both of jiyeong’s wrists in a tight grip. her other hand slowly went up to wrap the cock into her fist, hips leaning forward to coat as much of it as possible in jiyeong’s slick.the tip caught on her clit a couple times and jiyeong let out a garbled noise, tears streaking down her cheeks as she let out a few struggling breaths. it was torture, as saebyeok controlled herself enough to punish jiyeong for her earlier misdeeds, refusing to push the cock into her tight cunt that was revulsing with every second that passed by.“please!” jiyeong begged, drool pooling out one side of her mouth and moaning as the tip got caught on her clit again, shaking in her spot. her body couldn’t take it anymore, desperate and waiting, probably looking like a pathetic slut and more slick pooled out of her cunt at the demeaning thought. finally, fucking finally she gasped breathlessly, her nails clawing at saebyeok’s hand that kept her in place, almost choking on her own spit as saebyeok finally pushed in with a relentless smack that had filled the air as their hips connected.“shit,saebyeok!” she sobbed, her walls tightening around the intruding object, but saebyeok pushed through with a huff, setting an unforgiving pace, the only sounds in the washroom that were heard was the slapping of skin and jiyeong’s loud moans. the coil in her stomach tightened unbearably, until jiyeong let out a scream as she came.it was muffled by saebyeok’s lips, however, yet a strangled sound fell through as saebyeok’s thumb pressed against her clit and jiyeong yelped as she came again. she gasped, squirming underneath saebyeok as she continued to get pounded into. it was clear that saebyeok’s goal was to overstimulate jiyeong, just as she had fantasized, but jiyeong wasn’t done yet. saebyeok of all people knew how insatiable she was when it came to her sex drive, which was exactly why she was trying to drive jiyeong to her climaxes as fast as possible to maximize her sensitivity.and maximize her sensitivity it did. just from saebyeok pushing in and out of her along with the ministrations against her clit had jiyeong coming three more times, struggling and screaming. her throat closed up and she choked as she tried pushing saebyeok away, still refusing to speak because that would mean that saebyeokwinsandgod,while jiyeong was desperate, while she knew that saebyeok would get her to do her bidding, jiyeong liked to pretend for saebyeok. the overpowering crush of defeat always had jiyeong feeling woozy and a deep, masochistic sensation that she was addicted to. the sweet smell of victory, on the other hand, had saebyeok more than eager to continue and proud of herself. in the end, it was really a winwin situation for the both of them.after jiyeong came the sixth time within a matter of minutes, she started to struggle against the hands holding her down with a yell, her back arching as she let out stuttering breaths, “saebyeok… i’m”“say it,” saebyeok whispered against her lips hotly, drilling into her at a faster pace as jiyeong grit her teeth with a muffled yell, “you know exactly what i want, so sayit.”“fuckin’biteme,” jiyeong responded, and really, she should’ve expected when saebyeok did exactly that, pulling away and clamping her teethhardinto the skin of jiyeong’s neck. “shitshitshit!”jiyeong came again, and she sobbed pitifully, begging with a crackling, raspy voice, “stop! stop… please.”saebyeok’s own resolve was cracking, sweating profusely as she didn’t stop even with jiyeong’s pleading, half moon marks dug into the back of her hand due to the insistent scratching from jiyeong’s nails.“one more,” saebyeok rasped as jiyeong became harder to subdue, her feet starting to kick out at her and her whole body pushing back against saebyeok. “you can handle one more for me, can’t you baby?”“no…” jiyeong whimpered, ithurtin a good way, but she could definitely only handle one last one before she broke, safeword already ready at the tip of her tongue.“you’re already close, you can do it,” saebyeok encouraged, before she carefully, tenderly, pinched the hard bud of jiyeong’s cunt.that was enough for her. her whole body shook uncontrollably, muscles tensing and cramping as she came one final time. saebyeok immediately slowed down to a still, leaning over and peppering kisses over jiyeong’s face lovingly. she wrapped jiyeong’s arms around her neck to give her support as she came down from her high.a couple of minutes later, the couple was cleaning up, the strapon now cleaned enough to be passable. saebyeok decided to put it back on, against her better judgement as they had no place to store it seeing as jiyeong had given her purse to ali earlier.said woman was currently clinging to her, makeup retouched up and a limp as they walked back towards the bar, ready to leave. it seemed that the men were also just about to leave, ali being the only one there by the time they came back.“didn’t want to leave jiyeong’s stuff unattended,” he explained, avoiding eye contact with the two of them and having been willing to wait to give it back. saebyeok nodded with a smile.“thanks, ali, see you in a couple of days for the familyfriendly gathering,” jiyeong said, voice cracking from her earlier screaming, “thanks.”everybody parted ways, saebyeok having laughed at gihun who pressed himself against the car window and waving like a drunkard. sangwoo was passed out in the passenger’s seat, and the three said their goodbyes after saebyeok and jiyeong denied the offer to be driven home. ali had more than enough on his plate.jiyeong was comfortably pressed into saebyeok’s side, leaning most of her weight into the comfortable warmth as they walked back to their apartment in silence together.jiyeong smiled. the life she had right now, no matter how hard it was to get to this point, was much more than enough for her."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34065412,If you ever want to be there,SquashGame (Pls_mdr_mee),"gihun heard it.the sound of a thrown smoke bomb clanging on top of tiled floors, smoke spreading faster and faster as it surrounded the room. voices shouting from among it, screaming over themselves trying to be heard, straining to see, begging to survive.gihun grasps the weapon in his hands harder, breath hitching in his throat as his eyes became more used to the smoke, his ears beginning to hear the voices crying out to him.“gihun”there was a sharp ringing in his ears. despite that he could still hear their voices clearly, like an echo in the night, it begged to be heard.“gihun”gihun clenches and unclenches his jaw, swallowing as he watched policemen trashed his colleagues. a kick to the ribs, a baton to the head, screams of pain and fear filled his head as gihun tried to make sense of it.he shakes, feeling his hand tremble as he latches on to the metal frame he’s carrying around as a weapon, nearly dropping it when he sees a familiar man run towards him, telling his body not to help even when he falls.the man held onto the metal frames of the barricade, the small window showing a scared, traumatized man and gihun wonders if his face shows the same expression.“gihun”blood spurt out of his mouth when the baton collided with the back of his head, his murderer behind him wearing the sigil of a supposed protector, and in front of him what used to be his friend.“gihun”the said man flinched, the low voice cutting through the smoke like a sharp sword cuts through paper. blinking away the tears in his eyes, he looks behind him to find sangwoo standing there, in the tshirt bearing the number 218 and his solemn, tired face.“i thought you said you didn’t have a nightmare.”gihun stared at the taller man for a moment, before looking back at the window. there is nothing now. no blood, no smoke, nothing except the cool tiled floor below underneath the glass piggy bank filled with the deaths of innocent people.he slumps down lower than before.sangwoo says nothing, stepping down to take a seat beside gihun instead.“i didn’t have a nightmare” gihun mutters, casted downwards. he could feel the heavy gaze of his childhood friend on him. “i…” he swallows,“i was deep in thought”sangwoo stays silent and gihun knows exactly what he’s doing, before he went into gambling, before sangwoo left for abroad, when life was still merciful and the world was still kind. they’d have moments like this too, when they were unsure, insecure, afraid. sangwoo would say nothing, trusting the awkward silence to urge gihun into talking, and each time without fail he confessed.but now he won’t.now he couldn’t.now…“you weren’t there when it happened” gihun whispered, the melancholy of his traitorous voice pierce through the darkness like cold water. he sees sangwoos head face a bit towards him.the silence continued for a minute before sangwoo decided he’s waited enough.“i wasn’t there when what happened?”for a moment gihun didn’t want to answer, he wanted to be petty. let him wonder for himself what happened, let him suffer his own consequences of leaving him behind. snark at his face saying, ‘you should have been there’.but he couldn’t, not now, not when he could still feel the unforgiving smoke in his eyes. not when he could still see the light leave his colleague’s eyes so clearly.“we once went on strike at my old company” gihun started, the strength in his voice starting to return as he stares at the floor in front of him, conjuring up memories of before. “we set up a barricade like this”“that car company you once worked in?” sanwoo asks, voice low, following gihun’s example as he stares towards the entrance looking at nothing in particular. “you worked as a chauffeur; i believe”gi hun looks at sangwoo in surprise, “how did you know?”“my mother told me; she talks about you a lot.”gihun stared at sangwoo, failing to keep his shock out of his face. he tried so hard to keep in touch with the man in front of him but no matter what he never returned his calls, never returned his texts, after years he stopped trying completely.he shook it off,“they fired us because they were financially troubled,” he chuckles, soft and slow, “i worked there over a decade, i had a million things to pay for…his voiced grows even softer, a slight voice crack strikes in the middle of his sentence. “my child was about to be born”if he turned to see sangwoos face he would see the same shock he felt the moment before, if he turned more to the left, he could see saebyeok’s face covered in subtle pity.“they suddenly told us to leave so i had no alternative. they ruined the company and held us responsible” it was slight, but it was there. fury, anger he had felt when the higher ups told him to get lost. his colleagues meeting up to make action against their bosses. “it made me furious”he could see it, the company’s gray, lifeless walls. a barricade of chairs and tables shielding small side of the wall opposite of the entrance. he remembers their faces; he remembers the conversations they shared.“just like now my colleagues and i took turns keeping watch at night to occupy the factory”he heard it first, the rapid knocks of the door opposite of them.“scared the police might barge in any minute”he heard it.“we trembled every night”…no one said anything, the silence stretching between them in the cold, creepy room. despite that, it felt comfortable, perhaps it was because gunhi had to let it out, perhaps it’s the irony of the situation.perhaps it was the company.sangwoo raised a hand to offer comfort but for some reason paused before he could reach gihun, who tenses in anticipation. after a second his hand flinches and places itself on gunhi’s shoulder. sangwoo giving a stiff smile to the other man before he looks down, obviously not used to comforting people.gihun smiles hesitantly back.a cough comes from behind them, flinching the two out of their gazes and looking back to see the old man holding his forehead in pain. gihun stands up quickly, immediently leaving sangwoo’s side.sangwoo looks over at the two of them where he is sitting, watching gihun put his hands on player 001’s head in worry, rushing to cool him down with a damp cloth only to find that he hasn’t got any water left. he sees movement in the corner of his sight though and turns to find saebyeok sitting up, scourging around for something. the moment she steps up is when he saw her holding a mostly empty bottle of water.he watched her held out the water bottle to gihun who takes it without answer, he tilts his head back towards the large empty floor of the room. letting himself think, wondering how the young girl who said time and time again that she didn’t trust anyone offered to help the frail old man. this is a game of life and death, and his timer was obviously running out. why should she offer to help him?saebyeok sat next to him, “you should sleep, i’ll take the next shift.”sangwoo turns to her, “how much did you hear?”“…enough”sangwoo stood up, walking towards his makeshift bed to get some rest but not before saying, “kind, isn’t he?”saebyeok turns to look at him, “he’s… trustworthy.”they said nothing more as sangwoo tucks himself into bed, his one arm over his forehead as he drifts into sleep."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34287916,Anything for you,Anxi0us_Trash,"gihun woke up and already he knew something was wrong. his chest felt as thought it was on fire, his hair was sticking to his forehead and he could feel the distinct feeling of something smooth between his cheeks.a shakey moan escaped his mouth as he snuggled deeper into the thin pillow beneath him. all senses seemed to be dialed all the way up to 10. everything was rather to hot, to close or to loud. he hated it.of course he knew what was going on. he'd presented as an omega long enough to recognise the symptoms. but why did it have to be here? why now?gihun is broken throught his thought process by a hand lightly shaking him.""gihun...wake up...gihun""'strange...i am up' he thought to himself for a moment before the realisation dawned upon him that he never actually opened his eyes.with much effort the omega was able to open up his eyes to reveal sangwoo standing above him, he was muttering something he couldn't quite hear.""this isn't good....do something...up""a confused look made its way onto gihun's face as he tried to distinguish just what the man was trying to say, he didn't get long to think however as soon sangwoo ran out of patience and instead opted to lift the shorter male himself.""nooo..."" complained gihun as he attempted to lay back down in the comfy blankets, better in the blankets where its safe.""come on gihun we need to go, you need to get sorted out before your sent wakes up ever alpha around here"" another pull and gihun was lifted fully off the ground and into sangwoo's waiting arms.finally taking into account of the younger man's words he realised that it was still in fact the middle of the night, fear quickly made its way into the omegas brain as he realised just exactly was going on.off in the corner he could see one or two people awake in their groups, most likely look outs, but no one who's sent seemed to be a cause of concern though. by the time gihun was practically carried over to the huge door sangwoo had already convinced one of the square head guys to let them leave.quickly enough he was brought to a bathroom by sangwoo and was quickly picked up and forcibly made to sit upon one of the various sinks.""gihun, you need to focus your attention on me ok?"" attention, gihun could do that. all he needs to do is focus on the alluring smell of pine would coming from the handsome alpha standing in front of him. easy peasy.a dopey smile made its way onto gihun's face as he leaned forwards onto his friend ""sangwoo!...you smell so nice, im glad your here"" for a moment sangwoo didn't reply, he simply allowed the omega a moment to cling onto him.""ok gihun, look at me"" he pulled the omega back to look him in the eyes ""let's get straight to the point, its only gonna take one then were going to head back before any other group realises were gone""gihun found himself staring at the alpha before him as he stated point blank what needed to be done, for some reason it began to make the wet feeling between his cheeks to increase.a quick intake of breathe and then gihun found himself pushed back against the sink with his legs pushed apart, sangwoo making quick work of pulling him out his pants and somehow even further into the wall.gihun feels smooth hands slowly make their way down his body, from his neck all the way down to his groin. a breathy moan and those hands are quick to get underneath him. cheeks pried open to reveal an already wet hole waiting to be satisfied.sangwoo pauses in his movements, ignoring the whimper coming from a certain omega, in order to marvel at the mouth watering sight in front of him.gihun pushed back against the sink, head leaning back against the mirror with sweat drenched hair and a obvious blush stretching across his face. his legs tight in around sangwoo's waist in order to find some semblance of purchase, another moan making its way from his throat.in sangwoo's opinion, gihun had never looked so incredibly beautiful.his hands go straight back to their job, fingers inserting themselves inside the awaiting hole with little to no resistance.gihun continued to make various kinds of moans as sangwoo found just what he was looking for.fingers worked the dark haired man open quickly and efficiently, not having much to time left to spare after sangwoo's moment of apriciation.with a whimper those fingers are removed leaving gihun feeling empty and stretched, however not for long.gihun can feel the tip of sangwoo quietly make its way to his greedy entrance before pushing in at a steady pace.tears begin to streak down the older man's face as the feeling of being stretched open by such the gorgeous alpha above him starts to really register in his brain after ages of feeling nothing but numb awareness.sangwoo brings gihun's hips forwards to meet with his own in order to quicken the pace, soon the sound of flesh on flesh is echoing throughout the room.moans and whimpers start to become louder as gihun begins to reach his breaking point.""sangwoo...sangwoo...i,i think"" is all gihun can get out before being sushed by said man.the pace doubles in speed as sangwoo brings them both to their orgasms with great speed and efficiency. gihun can feel sangwoo raise him up so he can rest his head on the nook of gihun's neck.sharp teeth bite down viciously on the shorter mans neck causing him to release with a shout, followed closely by sangwoo who keeps his teeth firmly in gihun's neck.useless babble strings from gihun as he allows himself to fall limp against the wall behind the sink, satisfied and numbed all at the same time.for a moment nobody moves, scared to disrupt the brief moment of peace in this place but it can only last for so long.sangwoo moves first, making his way to clean the two of them up in silence. only sound to be heard are slightly laboured breathes from gihun who seemed to have trouble coming back to himself.once the two were cleaned, and sangwoo had tucked both him and gihun into their respective clothing, sangwoo coaxed gihun off of the sink and towards him.with minimal effort from the throughly fucked omega, sangwoo was left to practically carry him yet again back to the main room.once the guards allowed them back in they quietly made their way back to their group where kang saebyeok was attending to the old man who was lying against the floor in a dazed like state.if gihun had not still be at the edges of mind numbing pleasure he would of jumped over and helped in anyways he could, however he was not in his right mind at this moment.gihun found himself behind layed down beside sangwoo as the taller of the two kept him close whilst he subtly checked over all the other groups, once no suspicious activity arouse he finally settled down with gihun.gihun smilled to himself as he found himself lulled to sleep by the distinct smell of pine wood and alpha pheromones."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34410592,Lost Marble,juniperscreams,"after the fourth game, gihun returned to the dorms with the singular marble held tightly in his trembling hands. it was the last thing that oh ilnam had given him, and as gihun had left the fourth arena in a state of shock, he had accidentally held onto it. no one had stopped him. he rolled it lightly in his palms as han minyeo gleefully rolled out of bed and recounted her tale, her comfortable nap away from the horror death game they lived every day. he listened with half an ear, but couldn’t stop replaying the memory of the old man in his head. oh ilnam had sacrificed so much for gihun and what had gihun done in return? betray him? with death looming over his head, he didn’t hesitate to take advantage of the other and reveal his true nature. come to think of it, the old man had helped him along the way so much, giving him so many things. gihun felt pathetic and ungrateful as he slumped down on his bed, covering his face with his hand, exhausted.“oppa,” a coy voice called over. “why are you laying around and moping like that? shouldn’t you be happy that you passed that game? i’m sure oppa’s tactics were amazing as usual.” han minyeo smirked, sitting herself down on the edge of the bed without asking for permission. gihun wanted to shoo her away, but he didn’t have the energy to so he was forced to listen to her babbling.“ya, are you ignoring me?” she asked after a while. “after i came all the way over to warn you?” her voice was rising in pitch and growing more screechy by the moment. “aish, ungrateful“han minyeo.” gihun sighed, drained. “what do you want?”han minyeo rolled her eyes where gihun couldn’t see her and finally got down to business. “i’ll trade you information in exchange for an alliance next round. i was safe this time because i had no one, but that might not be the case next time. you in or not?” she huffed and bounced impatiently on the bed.gihun waved at her to go on with his other hand. han minyeo sighed and blew a hair out of her face, relaxing against the back of the bed. “the thing in your hand.”he tightened his grip involuntarily and warning sounds blare in his mind. “what?”“it’s not like you’re hiding it. you’ve been fidgeting with it since you came back.” she leaned over closer to his ear. “oppa, could that be a secret weapon you stole from the last game?”it was a cruel way to relive the nightmare he just went through, if he were to correct her and explain what he was holding and where, from who he got it from. so he just shrugged and let her keep her assumptions.“i knew it!” she crowed. “well then, oppa, you better keep it safe. and i know the perfect place.”he raised the hand off his face and turned to look at her for the first time. she had a sly and secretive grin on her face as she mouthed to him. “my vagina.”gihun jolted as if he had been shocked and scooted as far away as possible from her as quickly as he could. han minyeo had the gall to pout at this, crossing her arms like a little girl throwing a tantrum.“what? you don’t know that these parts exist?” she asked, affronted and gihun quickly waved his hand to disperse her assertions.“no, no! i have nothing against tthat, ma’am. but, why?” he was red with embarrassment, but moreover he was confused! what did she mean by that?han minyeo was running out of ways to show how annoyed she was with him, so she blew her hair and rolled her eyes twice to make sure he saw. “you men are so worthless.”“…”“the second game.” she said. “you know how i helped that fucking douchebag over there?” she gestured over to 101 with her chin and glared at him out of the corner of his eye.gihun scratched his head sheepishly. “i didn’t actually know, but now i do.”“aish, you missed how cool i was saving his life! i passed him a lighter so he could burn the dalgona shape out.” han minyeo insisted. “otherwise he would be dead meat by now! anyways, a lighter is cheating and a big no go, but actually, i snuck it in after coming back from the squid game the second time.” she looked quite proud of this, a big smile on her face.“how?” gihun furrowed his brow.“you dumbass!” han minyeo growled. “that’s what i’ve been trying to tell you this entire time, yo! i hid it in a container up my cooch. they didn’t search there so i was able to keep it safe all this time! yahaha!” she cackled. “so, what do you think?” she blinked up at him, waiting for his response.gihun’s confusion was obvious on his face, so she just forced on. “give me your special weapon and i’ll keep it safe right in here!” she patted her lower abdomen and leered at gihun. if gihun had not been grossed out by the entire conversation that one movement would’ve made him leave the conversation immediately. fortunately for him, at that exact moment a soldier came in to gather people to take for a restroom break. gihun immediately ran over and followed the soldier to the restroom, moving so fast that han minyeo didn’t even have a chance to complain.that woman…gihun thought to himself as he lowered his pants to piss. there wasn’t even a word to describe how crazy she was. well, he knew that all of them were a little kooky in the head or they wouldn’t be here, but she was well above his expectations; she was unpredictable. he sighed with relief and tugged his sweats back on after he had completely emptied his bladder. however, one part of the conversation they had still stuck in his brain.what if theydidtake away the marble?gihun wasn’t sure how useful it would be, but he pulled it out of his pocket to look at anyways. it was so ordinary that it seemed out of place. would they really take this away, considering it an advantage?he hesitated. it was not something he wanted to lose. and with this determination, he followed han minyeo’s advice, but probably not in the way she intended it.with a little plop, he slipped the marble in his ass for safe keeping.gihun had been looking a little crazed and wideeyed all throughout the last day so it was a matter of time before he came to sangwoo for guidance. so it didn’t surprise him when an hour before lights out, gihun pulled him away from the group, citing that he needed help with something very personal.sangwoo tapped his foot impatiently, but waited quietly for gihun to breach the topic. he looked uncomfortable about it all, wringing his hands together and flushing a bit as he glanced up to meet sangwoo’s eye. needless to say, this stupid issue of this could be resolved simply and much faster if he hadn’t waited all this time, but sangwoo was generous enough to not mention gihun’s faults. unfortunately the inverse was not always true.“sangwoo…” gihun started. “i have something to tell you.”sangwoo inclined his head, gesturing for the other to continue. but gihun had stuttered to a stop, awkwardly searching for a way to explain his issue.“you remember the last game.” of course sangwoo did. he regretted his decision, but not over his choice to live. “after the game ended, i still had one of the marbles from the game in my possession.” strange, but not a big issue. so what was bothering him?sangwoo waited for gihun to pull out the marble and show him. but the other stayed stock still, except for the constant fidgeting. sangwoo slowly raised an eyebrow at the other.“ok, this marble. where is it?”if it was possible, gihun flushed redder.“the marble,” gihun whispered. “it’s stuck.”“stuck where?” sangwoo looked around, but there was no place for gihun to ridiculously jam the marble away and hide it. “you have to tell me or i can’t help you.” sangwoo threatened, hurrying this along and forcing this charade to end.“it’s stuck in my ass!”“.”a beat.“what do you mean it’s stuck!?” sangwoo shouted, perturbed.gihun made a frantic motion to shush the other. “it means i can’t get it out!” he said, quietly, frustrated.sangwoo was reeling from this information and the visual image in his head of gihun, bending over to insert the marble into his ass. not like he knew what it looked like, or wanted to see for that matter; it was like when your brain unhelpfully supplied an image of your 70 year old gramps high school teacher jerking it with his wife.he took a deep breath to calm down, but it didn’t help at all. in fact, what he really wanted to do right now was tear his own hair out. he wanted one of the guards to take mercy on him and shoot him in the head so he didn’t have to deal with this mess called gihun. taking a couple more deep breaths, like it would do something, he bid his time till he could reply to gihun.“you…” sangwoo ground his teeth. “the level of idiocy you have exceeds all of my expectations.”“yes, yes! i’m an idiot!” gihun begged. “so, help this idiot out! just this once!”sangwoo used his hand to wipe his face, bemoaning the day he met gihun and became involved with him. “it should come out naturally, no?” he explained.“naturally?”“when you shit.” sangwoo deadpanned. “when you shit, it’ll come out.”“…”“…?”“the thing is,” gihun hesitated, and sangwoo had a sinking feeling in his stomach. “i haven’t shit at all since we got here. they never feed us a balanced diet, you know?” he had the audacity to look wronged. “if they don’t give us fibers, wouldn’t anyone get constipated?”the entire way to the bathroom, sangwoo held gihun’s hand like a vice in his grip. gihun stumbled along, trying to keep up with his fast pace, but sangwoo ignored all his complaints. when they arrived to the bathroom, he pushed the other into the stall and slammed him against the wall, breathing heavily in his space.gihun grunted from the impact and looked up at sangwoo, noticing the lack of space between them. he tried to shrink away from the other to distance himself, but with the wall behind him, there was nowhere to run.“strip.” growled sangwoo.“no!” gihun yelped, panic seeping into his voice.“you asked me to help you!” sangwoo shouted, irritation riding out his more reasonable urge to gently coerce the other. gihun always got on his nerves like this, like he knew the right buttons to make sangwoo go crazy. this was yet another one of those times and sangwoo felt his breath coming fast and his hands sweating, as if being around gihun gave him a fever. it might as well be true.“well…” gihun trailed off, looking away. sangwoo crowded closer and slowly reached up a hand to rest on the wall next to gihun, trapping him in. “could you… close your eyes?” he finished feebly.sangwoo felt his brain stutter to a halt. his eyes roamed over gihun’s embarrassed face, as if to memorize it, before he complied and shut his eyes tight. in his mind, he thought that if he followed along with gihun they might be able to finish this fiasco quicker. it sounded reasonable.with sangwoo’s eyes shut, both his sense of hearing and touch were heightened. he felt the miniscule shifts of air as gihun shucked his pants down, heard the fabric drop down to the floor with a thump. slowly he opened his eyes and looked down to meet gihun’s frightened eyes. gihun held his hands defensively over his lower region, but the jacket was just big enough to hide his bare lower half. but as sangwoo gaze traveled lower, he confirmed that the pants were on the floor and that gihun’s bare calves and thighs were all in view. they were hairy and trembling, but somehow sangwoo felt a vicious possessive feeling rise in his chest, so he hurried to give gihun more instructions, lest he wrest with own inner turmoil.“turn around.”“you’re in the way.” gihun complained, putting his hands on sangwoo’s shirt as if to shove him away. “sstop bullying your hyung like this, won’t you? i’m already embarrassed to make a mistake like this at my age.” he huffed. with a light shove from the other sangwoo moved out of the way and gihun slipped around him. there was the clink of the toilet seat being lowered and a soft grunt as gihun plopped himself down on the seat.“there. happy?” gihun called and sangwoo turned around to meet him.nothing could’ve prepared him for the sight that greeted him, gihun his childhood friend’s bare ass in the air, arms resting on the top of the toilet. there was a hint of a cheeky grin on his face, but it was strained; gihun was still embarrassed by this even though he tried to lighten the heavy atmosphere with his jokes. his face was flushed and sweaty though they hadn’t even done anything yet, and the flush trailed down his neck and dusted over the corner of his clavicle that was slightly exposed. it was all together too much. sangwoo felt as if the shock of the view made him have a short out of body experience. he must’ve stood still for too long because gihun made an impatient sound and sangwoo came closer, like a sailor drawn to the call of a siren.it didn’t make any sense to him. an old man like gihun… surely that would make him feel grossed out. but as he stared at the tense but slightly flabby muscles in the others thighs, the hairy calves and of course the pert globe of an ass, risen high in the air… sangwoo felt face heat up like a horny teen. come to think of it, how come gihun’s ass was this… appealing? he was both old and a man, yet sangwoo wanted to knead the shape prostrated in front of him and leave bold red handprints on it, marking him.“i’m going to start, ok?” sangwoo asked, forcing his voice to be level. he wasn’t sure how effective it was, but gihun didn’t seem to notice, being too nervous himself.“well, what’s your plan?” gihun squeaked as sangwoo lightly placed one hand on his thigh, the other ghosting over his ass. he squirmed in sangwoo’s grip, almost pushing back against the light touches. perhaps he was a little ticklish.sangwoo pulled his reasoning out of gihun’s ass. “ever had a colonoscopy?” he asked. gihun shook his head and had a confused look on his face. “never mind. well there’s a medical procedure that goes up your ass as well and i’m going to do something akin to that. it shouldn’t be too hard.” he finished as he inserted his first finger into gihun’s pink scrunchie.“yeek!” gihun screeched, slapping at sangwoo’s arm. “out! out! take it out!”sangwoo, amidst the flailing arms, withdrew his one finger, furrowing his brow. “stop making such a fuss over this.”“it hurts!” gihun wailed. “you don’t know how much it hurts—would you like me to do it to you instead?” he retorted, enraged. “there must be a better way to do it!”sangwoo sat back on his haunches as he considered the assshaped dilemma before him, staring at gihun’s asshole like it might offer an answer to their problem. gihun was swearing under his breath as he gripped the toilet lid hard enough for his hands to turn white.well, sangwoo supposed. the conundrum was that gihun’s ass was too tight to reasonably enter without lube. and, there would be no way to extract the marble if gihun was wailing at the top of his lungs and hellbent on beating sangwoo up.well, there was a simple solution to this.slowly, as to not spook the mumbling gihun, sangwoo leaned over and carefully licked a stripe up gihun’s asshole.sangwoo felt rather than saw gihun stiffen, but he definitely heard the moan that gihun gave out. of course, gihun quickly stifled this sound with his sleeve, frantically looking behind him to gauge whatever the hell sangwoo was doing. but, it was fine by sangwoo as gihun had stopped struggling, and couldn’t even voice his complaints without exposing how he was feeling. so, sangwoo dedicated himself to licking gihun’s ass and feeling him shiver beneath him. it’s not like sangwoo had much experience, but he supposed that it felt good enough for gihun. he pulled away for a second to check this, and saw gihun’s red and weeping erection straining under him, and couldn’t hide the smile it brought him. sangwoo then renewed his actions with even more fervor, switching between nibbling on the rim and spearing gihun with his tongue. whatever he did, he could feel gihun reacting beneath him, as he squirmed to get away but sometimes, sometimes pushed his ass closer to sangwoo’s face like he couldn’t get enough.sangwoo felt like he might be suffocating from gihun’s ass. but, he was taking breaks to catch a breath before he dove in each time, so maybe it wasn’t from that. either way, his chest hurt so much it was hard to breathe.it was hard to pull away, but sangwoo wanted to ask the defeated gihun something. as he pulled away, he was content noticing the precum beads dotting the toilet lid. it was satisfying to know that he did that.“is that good for you?” sangwoo asked as he kissed up gihun’s thigh aimlessly, nipping his fatty cheek as he arrived near the top. gihun shuddered helplessly in his grasp and sangwoo gripped his thigh tighter, lest gihun fall off and ruin the fun. gihun freed teeth from his sleeve, gasping for air and trying to slow down his running heart before he answered.“well, it doesn’t hurt…” gihun replied. how cheeky, to reply with a nonanswer like that.  sangwoo took it as his cue to move right along.“you feel loose enough now.” sangwoo reasoned. “i think you’ll be able to take this easily.” he suddenly breached gihun with two fingers, scissoring him open. gihun arched his back off the toilet seat, mouth open in a silent scream. but sangwoo wanted to hear him wail. like an assassin looking for his target, sangwoo silently but effectively located gihun’s prostate and attacked it like his life was on the line. gihun was loud now, his sounds ricocheting off the tile walls, moaning like he was paid to do it.sangwoo smirked to himself. he didn’t know whether gihun was overly sensitive or if he was too good at this; either way it was doing amazing things for his ego. his dick too, was having a great time, stiff as a rock in his pants. gihun didn’t know how sexy and erotic he was, but sangwoo was a business man and would always follow through with his contract before he went to extraneous things, so he searched around gihun’s intestines, inserting a third finger to help him look for the shitty marble that started it all.it was difficult; this is why people shouldn’t stick things up their ass unless there was a cord to draw it out or a base for it to not slide into the depths. but, after some searching sangwoo found the fucking marble in one of the folds of gihun’s ass intestines and drew it out, dropping it recklessly on the floor. it rolled out of the stall and sangwoo pulled his hand out.throughout this marble echolocation, gihun had already released, his cum coating the lid of the toilet. shudders racked his body and without sangwoo’s hands supporting him, he collapsed like a house of cards, slumping over the toilet seat, his asshole opening and closing to cope with the thick fingers that had just been rummaging around the interior.sangwoo pulled his cock out of his pants and after a few quick pulls, he came as well; the erotic image of gihun laid out in front of him was too much stimulation. he messily pulled up his pants and unsteadily stood up before he unlocked the door. sangwoo turned back to look at the gihun who was so tired he was on the verge of falling asleep.“clean yourself up.” he reminded the other, walking out of the bathroom."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34379929,Cooking Lessons.,http_sangwoo,"for sangwoo, there was nothing better than coming home from an exhausting day at the office and seeing a steaming plate of delicious food already waiting for him at the table. for sangwoo, gihun’s cooking was the best way to feel the older man’s love.however, gihun’s culinary skills weren’t what surprised him the most once they formalized their relationship: it was the affection and detail he gave to hispacked lunch. at first, the younger man was scandalized, but the events of said first time only made him appreciate even more gihun’s beautiful preparations.back to that day, sangwoo almost threw his cup of boiling coffee against gihun’s face when he saw bearshaped rice decorated meticulously with seaweed.“what the fuck?!” sangwoo shouted, gihun flinching at the sound.proceeding to eat the now torn apart ball of rice, the older man rolled his eyes at his partner, “what? i’m preparing your lunch for work, sangwooah.” and then smiled innocently, retrieving the – quite big – lunchbox from an upper cabinet.drinking his coffee in one gulp, sangwoo stayed behind gihun crossing his arms over his chest, watching with a raised eyebrow how his boyfriend packed stirfried kimchi, spicy braised tofu, yellow pickled radish, and the previously shaped rice balls in three different sections, accommodating them perfectly inside the polyester object before zipping it.sangwoo cracked the bones in his hand to stop him from losing control, somewhat ashamed to bring that to the office. “you expect me to eat all of that? in the... 20 minutes i get of free time?”gihun grabbed the lunchbox and took it with him to the front door, the younger man following him close expecting an answer. stopping before it, gihun stretched it to him, the still wonderful smile in his face easing his fury down.“yes,” he answered, “because if you don’t, i’m going to divorce you.”taken offguard, sangwoo doubled over as he laughed, holding on to his knees when his stomach began to hurt. “we’re not even married, hyung.”gihun’s hands adjusted his tie, looking down at his lips as he talked, “okay so we get married and 20 minutes later i’ll make a huge scene at the court asking for a divorce.”with this man’s humor, sangwoo couldn’t stay angry for long.gihun kissed his lips once the door was opened, wishing him a good day at work and promising his favorite dish for dinner when he came back.once at the office, he followed his daily routine without problem, signing papers and talking to clients; glancing at the clock every few minutes desperate for lunchtime to arrive. his silver lunchbox instantly drew attention, for two reasons only.cho sangwoo lived on coffee from the old, rusty kettle in the cafeteria and packed sandwiches from the 7/11 across the building.he finally settled down with the wellknown seong gihun.his coworkers started walking by his office as he opened the lunchbox, his mouth watering instantly at the glorious smell that emerged from the closed packages; from then, every single worker used any stupid excuse they could think of just to get inside the room and savor such wonderful scent.getting annoyed at the little privacy he was receiving, sangwoo tried to calm down by savoring gihun’s spicy braised tofu, only to be interrupted by the youngest accountant on the building. hwang junho.“hey there, mr. cho!” the young boy exclaimed as he took a seat in front of his desk, sangwoo staring at him dead in the eye. “i see gihunhyung packs your lunch now, it’s not like you could’ve done all of this with your pathetic self anyway.”sangwoo hummed, continuing to eat with his head lowered down, junho’s last comment making a weird feeling settling in his stomach.resting his chin on his hand, junho proceeded with his teasing, “and, how is it?”“good,” sangwoo answered coldly, grabbing the packet with the decorated rice balls and radish. which turned out to be his biggest mistake.junho immediately saw the lovely detailed food, raising from the chair as he squeaked, “oh my god! that’s so cute! is it possible if your boyfriend packs a lunch for me too?”oh, boy, that was the straw that broke the camel's back.feeling anger and jealousy dominate him, sangwoo slapped his desk with both hands; junho almost fell backwards, rushing out of the office when he saw his boss walking around his desk with murder in his eyes. junho’s associates running behind him once they noticed how big they have fucked up.“everyone stay where you are,” sangwoo commanded in a deep, irritated voice, freezing the office in its place. “i’m getting sick of your attitude,” he emphasized, tugging his hair stressed out. “because it’s none of your fucking business if my partner packs me lunch or not.”the room stayed silent, only shaky breaths audible in the milieu. “especially you, hwang junho,” sangwoo called him out, a vein in his temple starting to show. “if i hear another word spoken about my private life, or see any of you walking by my office again, i won’t hesitate on getting you kicked out of here, understood?”several heads nod, but it’s not enough for the darkeyed. “understood?!”“yes, sir!” the words echoed, sangwoo’s back facing them before they can react in any other way.and for the rest of the shift, nobody dared to emit even the lowest of sounds.hours later, finally parking at the entrance of his home, sangwoo let his head fall onto the steering wheel, exhaling deeply as he finally understood the reason why he felt so angry at hwang junho’s comments.he stood there for long minutes, losing track of time until gentle knocks on his window took him out of his trance. raising his head as he gasped, he found the worried face of his partner, who grabbed the handle and opened the unlocked door.“sangwooah,” gihun whispered when he took a good look at the younger man’s appearance. he looked drained. “what happened? i was about to call you because it was past your arrival time.”“nothing,” sangwoo quickly said, grabbing his briefcase and getting out of the car, tripping on his own feet.gihun instantly catches him, tossing sangwoo’s arm over his shoulders, taking the keys from sangwoo’s hand and locking the car. putting them on his sweatpants’ pocket, the older man guided them inside.with sangwoo already seated on his usual spot, but uncharacteristically quiet, gihun bit his bottom lip nervously, serving the red hot soup in a large bowl.holding the plate in his hands, gihun put it in front of sangwoo’s frozen eyes. “look, like i promised you, jjamppong.” the older man shakily declared, sangwoo’s body finally reacting to his voice.“thank you, hyung.” the younger man whispered, grabbing the chopsticks and taking some of the noodles in his mouth.satisfied with his reaction, gihun walked back to the kitchen to get his plate, seating beside sangwoo a few minutes afterwards.both eat in silence, gihun stealing glances at his boyfriend every now and then, noticing how he ate less and less, until he was just moving the shrimp and mussels around with his chopsticks, a defeated expression on his face.“sangwoo, baby, you’re worrying me,” gihun broke the silence, dragging his chair closer to sangwoo. “there’s something you’re not telling me.”the younger man stayed quiet, his gaze fixed on the delicious dish his boyfriend had prepared. sangwoo felt the tears stinging his eyes, starting to blink rapidly in an attempt to not burst out crying.gihun noticed it; of course he did, making his worry skyrocket. “sangwooah,”“am i pathetic, hyung?”what?startled, gihun thought for a second he misheard, only when he saw the first tears streaming down sangwoo’s face at his silence realized he, in fact, didn’t.“you, the proud and joy of ssangmundong, pathetic? are you serious?” he laughed in disbelief, running his hand through sangwoo’s hair. “who was the dumb fuck who told you that, huh? because i’ll be damned before someone dares to make my boyfriend this miserable.”sangwoo sobbed at the protective tone on gihun’s voice, wondering – not for the first time – if he even deserved to have the privilege of being seong gihun’s boyfriend. sympathy washed over gihun’s face, pulling sangwoo’s body against his, holding him tightly as the younger man shed shameful tears on gihun’s sweater.it hurt the way sangwoo was a completely different person at home; how he wasn’t the allpowerful boss of his department but the sentimental, vulnerable, gihun’s sangwoo.“i’d dare say today is your lucky day, sangwooah,” gihun murmured when the crying subsided, sangwoo’s face still tucked to the crook of his neck.“why?” a muffled voice responded.“because,” gihun began, slowly removing sangwoo from his hideout. “i prepared something… special for us tonight, without knowing any of this was going to happen.” he smiled, cleaning with his sleeve the drying tears on sangwoo’s cheeks.sangwoo grimaced, his little episode exhausting him even more. “hyung, ii –” he stuttered, “i’m so tired right now, i just want to sleep.”“i promise you’re going to like it, come on,” gihun didn’t even let him protest when he was already dragging him to the kitchen by his hand like a little kid.on the small island, multiple ingredients laid there; the basic ones to make bread, sangwoo’s poor culinary knowledge concluded. gihun’s hand led him to a nearby chair, sitting him in front of the products.“i’m going to preheat the oven, just a sec’,” the older man announced, dropping a small kiss to the top of his head, making sangwoo smile. when he was back, he arrived with several things he didn’t recognize. “tonight, you’ll be the chef, mon amour.”sangwoo’s heart dropped.“no, no no no no,” sangwoo refused, trying to run away from the scene, gihun’s strong arms – from recently starting to work out – keeping him in place.“none of that now, sangwoo,” gihun scolded him, sitting him back on the chair. “i’m here to guide you through the whole process, alright?”hesitant, sangwoo nodded, an empty bowl is placed in front of him. “add two cups of flour,” gihun ordered him, taking the measuring cup and filling it to the desired quantity. “good, now add one teaspoon of baking soda.”the younger man frowned, watching the several spoons placed before his eyes. “how am i going to know which one is the right one?” he quietly asked, feeling stupid because the answer was right there and he simply didn’t have the strength to try.gihun, patient as ever, separated three spoons from the rest. “these are teaspoons, but with different measuring, pick the one that reads ‘1 tsp’.”and so on, sangwoo added the dry ingredients one by one, gihun being there every step of the way, telling him if he was adding more or less than he should have.“now,” gihun clapped his hands together, a mischief smile forming on his lips. “the best part.”in a separate bowl, two eggs, butter, brown sugar and three overripe bananas are laid. gihun took them out carefully, placing them in a safe area. “crack the eggs, add half a cup of butter and ¾ cup of brown sugar while i mash the bananas, okay?” sangwoo nodded, starting to feel motivated.sangwoo stirred with all his might the ingredients in the bowl, stopping when gihun added the mashed bananas onto the batter, looking at him with a wide smile and sparkling eyes. together, they mixed all of the ingredients, dipping the tip of their fingers on it just to take a small taste. pouring the batter in a greased pan, sangwoo left gihun doing the last part of their journey, walking to the living room and putting his hands inside his pockets, balancing on his heels.“congratulations, sangwoo!” gihun exclaimed as he hugged him from behind, pressing a kiss to the nape of his neck. “you just made your first banana bread, oh! i’m so proud of you.”“it’s nothing…” sangwoo tried to downplay it, looking to the opposite side with his cheeks burning. “compared to what you do, this is nothing.”“for me it’s everything, sangwoo,” the older man affirmed, leaving a long trail of kisses from his neck up to his head. “what i love the most about our relationship is that i always learn something new about you.”“another weakness, you mean.”gihun tsked, releasing sangwoo from his hold. “aish, cho sangwoo! stop being so negative!” quieting when he saw the insanely adorable pout on sangwoo’s lips. “and stop trying to avoid a scold by acting cute!”“only if you hold me again.” the businessman rapidly negotiated, cringing at the childish tone he said it.nevertheless, gihun seemed to fell for it, his arms trapping him again in seconds. sangwoo felt… special? would that be the correct word to use? every time he felt at his lowest point, gihun brought him back to life, and made him feel like he was floating in paradise – god, how corny –; like he truly belonged there, in his arms, wrapped in his cheap but breathtaking perfume.“i love you, gihun,” sangwoo whispered, gihun’s hands stroking his back tenderly. “thank you.”needless to say, there was a reason why the following day hwang junho left his resignation letter at sangwoo’s desk with a dark eye and a bloody nose."

""hmm?"" he says, his face deadpan. he knows he looks tired. and sad. but the young korean intern doesn't seem to notice. she forces a smile, ""i just wanted to make sure you're okay  you looked like you were zoning out."" she says in korean and sangwoo inhales sharply. his chest shudders and he tries to believe it wasn't noticeable.he shakes his head. ""no, i'm fine."" and then starts scribbling in his notebook. he doesn't know what he's writing, but he can feel himself zoning out again, a certain man entering his mind. he exhales and hears a shuffle. the intern is still there.he raises his head, ""is there anything else?"" he asks, as politely as he can manage. the intern smiles a little sheepishly, ""the card you just got..."" she starts, ""was it a wedding invitation?"" she asks, her tone excited. sangwoo wishes he could jump out the window.he offers her a polite quick smile, ""yes."" and just as the intern starts looking more interested in the topic, he raises a hand pointing it to the door, ""you can leave now."" the intern blushes furiously, embarrassed and sangwoo just goes back to scribbling onto his notebook as the young woman scrambles away.his phone buzzes and he checks his schedule. he has a meeting in two hours he needs to prepare for. he faces his laptop, ready to start working, but the card catches his eye again, and he gulps down the bitterness in his mouth.this isn't the time.he reminds himself.so he looks at the laptop screen, and starts working.seong gihun. the card said.seong gihun.gihunhyung. hisgihun hyung.  he stares at the bright laptop screen long enough for his eyes to start getting watery. at least that's what he tells himself.this isn't the time.sangwoo was a smart child. he always had been. so smart, in fact, that he was deemed the pride of ssangmundong. gihun wouldn't waste a second before bragging about sangwoo to the first person they'd meet and sangwoo would always smile at the ground, glancing at gihun's excited and happy face. sangwoo always felt that he was one step behind gihun. he was the pride of ssangmundong, but to him, gihun was enough. gihun had always been enough. that, if it were up to him, he'd do anything and everything for gihun.the last time gihun and sangwoo had seen each other was before the younger left for university. it was long ago. gihun probably forgot all about it. but not sangwoo. how could sangwoo ever forget?they were about to part ways when gihun had suddenly reached for sangwoo's hand.""sangwooah"" he said and fished out a pen from his pocket with his free hand. ""don't you forget about us, okay?"" sangwoo remembers the way he had stilled, his hand in gihun's as the older opened his palm, sketching on his skin. ""if you do, i'll be really mad."" sangwoo gulped, as he looked at his hand, gihun drawing on it. ""you're the pride of ssangmundong, but i'm the one who's most proud of you, okay?"" the elder pulls the pen away and sangwoo looks at the messy shiny star he had made. ""don't tell your mom i said that.""sangwoo can't help but laugh, his chest feels like it's on fire. ""i won't. i won't forget, hyung."" he murmurs and gihun smiles at him. it's the way he smiles. the way gihun always smiles. wide and happy. sangwoo could feel his heart hammer in his chest, with a feeling he knew all too well.""the smartest kid in town."" they called him. yet it took him more than a decade to realize he's in love with his best friend. he laughed, a short exhale, as if in mockery. he wonders if he could just throw everything away and stay here with gihun.""you should go."" gihun says, ""you'll be late.""sangwoo has been dreading returning to his empty apartment all afternoon. which is why he goes drinking first. one of his coworkers offers to go with him, but he declines with a forced smile. the coworker looks surprised but doesn’t say anything more. sangwoo doesn’t care if he seems impolite, he wants to be alone. so, he gets drunk at the bar near his apartment building, eyeing the invitation, turning it in between his fingers over and over.he had told gihun to wait. to wait for him, just before he left. gihun had looked at him oddly, “what do you mean?”“just… wait, okay hyung? wait for me.”gihun had smiled, shaking his head, “i won’t be going anywhere, sangwooah”sangwoo shoves the invite in his briefcase and gets up to leave.he opens the door and trudges in. it's dark inside. he feels tired. he feels so tired. he throws his bag on the couch and when the cardconvenientlyfalls out he closes his eyes, his throat tightening as he clenches his fists. maybe he should've just thrown it out. he isn't going to attend anyway. the gold lettering on the card shines and sangwoo forces himself to look away.the two of them had always been inseparable in that small town of theirs and his mom had often teased him about how girls would never talk to either of them if they always stuck together. younger sangwoo always thought it was weird. younger sangwoo also thought long and hard about it until he realised he didn't like it when he was away from gihun. maybe his mom was right. turns out all they needed was time apart and suddenly gihun had a girlfriend whom he decided to spend the rest of hislifewith and nownow they're getting married.sangwoo breathes in, shakily. his head hurts, his chest hurts. everything hurts so much. he grabs the invitation from the ground and sits on the floor, back to the corner of the room. what was he expecting? gihun to wait for him? gihun to accept his feelings? gihun to not move on with his life after sangwoo had left?you're so fucking stupid.a voice rings clearly in his mind.what were you expecting?something wet is on his cheek and he wipes it to realize a single tear had slid down. he sighs, exasperated.he forgot.you couldn't forget but he did.another tear.sangwoo wipes at it hastily, clenching his jaw.stopit. he tells himself.another.stop.another.fucking hell.he lets out a breath he didn't know he was holding and it comes out as a loud sob. ""fuck"" he mutters under his breath, taking off his glasses and tossing them in front of him. he sobs again, his chest suddenly heaving. he can't make it stop. the tears keep coming.sangwoo holds his head in his hand, every exhale coming out as a sob, his whole body is shaking as he bites down on his other hand. he weeps into his hand, muttering angry curses from time to time. the tears don't stop as he gasps for air until his eyes are screwed shut and all he can see is gihun. seong gihun.""fuckinghell, hyung!""he shouts in between sobs, his voice rings in the empty apartment.he claws at his chest, throwing his head back.""fuckinghell.""his heart crumbling with every passing second."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34280716,time is still ours to spend,hitonatsunotapestry,"the first droplet fell on his hand as he stretched it out. his other hand clutched the award he received for the best academic performance in his overall grade. he truly did not expect it. he knew he never putthatmuch effort in his studies so no one was there to cheer for him when he collected it and he did not bother to ask his mother in the morning to pick him up later. it was pouring and he could see figures covered in raincoats holding their umbrellas above their children rushing to their cars. unlike them sangwoo had no umbrella so he remained at the school entrance shying away from the terrible cold he would get if he attempted to run home. he crouched down and dusted off the step before sitting on it. for a good ten minutes he sat there watching the raindrops, counting the ones he stopped from hitting the ground until he heard a muffled scream of his name. their voice got louder as they reached the gates and sangwoo looked up only to see gihun frantically waving his hands. his rainbow colored raincoat made him look ridiculous. he raced to the gate and stepped under the umbrella gihun opened.“hyung, thank you.”“for what?”“for picking me up, i know mom is busy these days so thanks for not making her worry.’’gihun grinned and hummed as they walked while sangwoo remained silent.the award was still in his hands and gihun finally noticed it.“what’s in your hands?”“an award.”“ is it for participation or something?”“nope, it’s for being the top student of the grade.”“really?” he said as he quickly turned to face sangwoo with his eyebrows quirked up and mouth gaping open.“yes.”gihun grabbed him into a chokehold and ruffled his hair congratulating him on his efforts. the peeking sunlight reflected in his eyes as he smiled at sangwoo who managed to wiggle himself out of his hold. for the first time in his life, sangwoo thought of wanting to see gihun smile more and maybe only for him. as he skipped down the road, he shouted praises of his dongsaeng being the genius of ssangmundong who would eventually go to seoul national university. sangwoo trailed after him, noting every wish he made for him.***************************there was a buzz of excitement surrounding the school. the junior girls planned on confessing to their senior crushes while the boys grumbled about losing their older friends. meanwhile the seniors could finally breathe after 12 harsh years of studying for the final exam.personally, sangwoo did not find it as difficult as he imagined but then he had been preparing for it for a long time. just to see gihun’s smile when he receives the acceptance letter to snu. he cleared his locker removing any personal items and stuffed them in his bag. when he closed it and turned his head he met the gaze of a junior standing near him.she greeted him and asked him to meet her at the staircase in the west wing to which he agreed. the walk to the west wing was a silent one. the girl was clearly nervous from the way she would try to discreetly look back and increase her pace to widen the distance between them. the west wing was not a common place for confessions; most preferred the tree behind the school. she fidgeted as she poured her heart out then ended her confession. he barely heard her but as always he thanked her for it and rejected her in a way she would not burst into tears on the spot. whenever he rejected someone he would imagine how his own confession would go.would that person smile at him and turn him down kindly? would they be horrified by it and distance themselves forever?their ceremony had been a joyful one full of jokes and tears from his peers when they were gifted their certificates. their class stood at the giant oak tree situated in front of the school scrambling to get the right spot before the class photo. his classmate wrapped an arm across his shoulder and pulled him closer. following the others he placed his fingers in a peace sign and smiled. the photo was filled with wishes of them hoping to see each other again. gihun stood near the gates holding a bouquet of flowers.“how was your last day of highschool?,” he said, handing him the bouquet.“fine.”“oh how i remember my last day even when it was so long ago,” he said, resting his cheek upon his hand and gazing into the distance as if he was recalling an event that happened twenty years ago.“hyung, that was three years ago,” he said, flatly.he laughed and ruffled his hair. his laugh had gotten deeper and a bit rough over the years yet to sangwoo it was sweeter than the dalgona candy sold by the old man at the playground.“you’ve got a little something on your head.”he reached his hand over his head and grabbed the little leaf. he dropped it on the pathway covered with deep red leaves and dull yellow leaves marking the approaching end of fall. soon he will be in seoul; a place without gihun.“hyung?”“yeah?,” he said, as they stopped near the bus stop.“i love you.”**************************************he sat at the bar taking little sips from his cold glass of whiskey. the chill breeze from the sea blowing cooled him further. he requested for another glass from the bartender ali whom he befriended somehow. he tended to talk about his wife and daughter whenever he missed them to sangwoo. gihun was busy chatting up the young couple at the beach. her partner and gihun instantly clicked becoming best friends in a matter of seconds. saebyeok passed by the bar ordering two mojitos for herself and gihun’s new friend jiyeong. sometimes he felt like he had met them before. he gulped down the last drop of whiskey and thanked ali. the beach at night was calm. the band at the bar switched to playing a softer song from the vibrant one they played.gihun stared at the moon, remaining silent even when he spotted sangwoo next to him.“the moon is really beautiful tonight, isn’t it?,” he said, meeting sangwoo’s gaze.you’re all long for, all i worship and adore.the soft breeze brushed his hair, the bright moonlight illuminating his little smile and his hand pushing his hair back.in other words, please be true.his hand caressed gihun’s cheek and he leaned in gently kissing him. their lips separated and he brought their foreheads together.“it really is,” he said, as their fingers entwined.in other words, i love you."

""why are you here?""gihun couldn't have picked a worse time. sangwoo was laying down in the bathtub, reeking of soju and smoke, trying to slowly kill himself. his mind was starting to drift in the farthest of places, and his thoughts were beginning to break apart, not until he heard the doorbell chime multiple times, and he knew he was obligated to stand up and answer.""oh, nothing, i just want to catch up!"" gihun smiles giddily, pulling up his stuffed bag from the floor. ""look, i brought soju!""sangwoo swallows back, making a decision.damn it, gihun.he regrets telling him his address earlier while they smoked, and how he told him to visit sometime. eyebrows furrowed, he sighs a little. ""no need for that. i have soju here. come in.""the motel sangwoo was staying in looked damp, and with every footstep he took, his feet would make a moist, slightly squeaking wet sound. he hated how it felt carrying these clothes, how cold he felt in them, and how they cling unto him.""i'll get changed. put the sojus on the counter, over there. there are sojus in the fridge too. crack one open if you want to already.""~two bottles in, and they can already feel the room get more humid. things in their view had started to swirl and dance, and they had felt as if they were in a daze.""sangwoo."" there was a slight slur in his tone, trying to attach himself to consciousness. ""i missed you. i only hear of you from your mother.""he can see how sangwoo grimaced at his sentence, gulping down his guilt and worry. gihun can see how he caves in inside, afraid of what he had brought up. ""sangwoo... did i say something wrong?""sangwoo smiles, and it fades away, averting his gaze below. ""nothing. just feeling guilty.""gihun tries to put his hand on sangwoo's shoulder as a sense of reassurance, but the other man puts it down gracefully. ""i've done alot of bad things. i regret this so much. it's so frustrating.""""hey, hey, it's okay."" gihun pats his back. he suddenly retaliates.""it's not! i've stolen from many people, i've been running away, i've i've been hiding! how many times have my mother talked about me in a heavenly light, how i was such a a smart and handsome young man who had gotten into seoul university? it pains me!"" he shrieked, and gihun flinched. ""how many people think i'm on a business trip in the states? how many people will be shocked if they found out i've been a fraud over many, many things!""sangwoo's eyes were beginning to glisten, and he lets out a frustrated breath, shaking from the whelm. he puts his hands on his head, hiding his face.he finally pulls himself together.""what happened to the pride of ssamundong?"", he mutters, broken.he was so, so pissed. gihun can tell.gihun bursts out, tripping over his words. ""it's your fault for stealing their money anyway! it's your fault!"" he screams at him, bolting up. ""you landed yourself in here! you know that! i know that! we've landed ourselves in such low places we can't even enjoy anything anymore!""the only thing pulling gihun's willpower together was the soju. he knew he can't say these things even if he tried.""i wish you never left!"" gihun screams, exasparated, anger pooling in his eyes. his legs shuddered. he feels his fury weaken, leaving only an incomprehensible sadness.there was a silence, where gihun tries to reassemble himself, and sangwoo feels the taste of guilt.stumbling from the couch, sangwoo slowly walks towards gihun, looking like he was about to tumble down. gihun watches him without a word, waiting for him to say something.once their faces were just mere inches apart, sangwoo tilts his head meekly with his breath stiffening. he places his hands on gihun's shoulders carefully, planting a peck on his lips. he turns to look at the other man, his eyes dewy with hunger, and he pleads.in a flash, they had shoved each other's lips against the other, kisses filled with passionate longing, holding on for dear life on the other's clothes. it was aggressive, and filled with fire and fulfillment. with how their faces are so close that they were practically touching, they can feel how warm their cheeks have gotten. their hands trace each other's shoulders and hips, and without their control, they had slammed against the wall.they break the kiss apart hastily, trying to catch their breaths. sangwoo and gihun fell to the floor, their clothes ragged and wrinkled. with how the sweat twinkled on gihun, he looked even more alluring.""gihun,"" sangwoo begs, huffing, keeping his hands clutched to the fabric around gihun's neck as his eyes glaze over him. his hair was now ruffled along with his sleeves, as crinkled as a wilting rose. there was a silence again, with stares and shaky exhales.""keep me warm tonight.""gihun's chest rises and falls rhythmically with sangwoo's heartbeat as he looks at the man,thisman, with his appearance disheveled and his pride torn down. he takes a sharp breath, the outline of his bones showing on his neck. gihun begins to feel remorse for screaming at sangwoo.""sangwoo... i'm sorry.""""don't say that.""~gihun had fallen asleep in the motel, his hair looking like a nest. soju bottles lined below the table, sangwoo told him to stay for the night, knowing he was exhausted, and he doesn't want to see him stumble and fall down on the way home a mess anyway. the doorbell rings once more, but it doesn't wake him up. sangwoo sees a card slip beneath the cracks. it had those familiar symbols.oh god."
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34121575,weight of you on my tongue,redmaynes,"sangwoo was drunk, that’s why he was even indulging in this in the first place.if it weren’t for his coworkers wheedling him to join them in their friday escapade, away from their monotonous jobs and wives’ sharp eyes, he would’ve already been on a train home, with no one awaiting him when he stepped through the door. bliss compared to the harrowing day he braved, with a slew of emails and documents that needed to be replied to and pored over.yes, that’s exactly the reason why he’s letting a man with a jawline that rivaled his, and dark mesmerizing eyes grind on him in the back of a gentleman’s club that has seen better days.if you think about it, it wasn’t like hesoughtthis out himself; it’s just that his coworkers are quite persuasive people, who goaded him into beckoning the dancer over to slip him a couple of crisp bills, more than enough to warrant a private dance.if sangwoo was drunk, maybe he can excuse this debauched behavior on the person he became when he was inebriated enough to not care about this his shameful, ofthidden indulgences. he knocked back the rest of his malt scotch a seductive blend of vanilla and honey with the barest hint of something darker and spicier lingering on his tongue long after he swallowed.the drink reminded me of the dancer in front of him: he looked young, way younger than sangwoo, with big eyes, plush lips, and legs that displayed almost deadly strength with how they supported him on and off the pole. sangwoo wanted those legs wrapped around his waist.how much would it hurt if you asked him to press his foot onto your neck?something murmured inside sangwoo’s ear. he blinked hard, shaking his head to will away the thought.“would you like to request anything in particular, sir?”“mm.” getting into the room with him was already more than sangwoo could hope for. he wasn’t sure if he was worthy of asking for anything else from such a lovely face.so he did what he’s best at in business matters. he deflected.“what’s a beautiful boy like you doing in a place like this?”the dancer didn’t so much as blinked. “you’re allowed to add any additional small service on top of the private dance that you paid for. if it’s your first time i can add in another one, on the house.”“i bet you’ve been getting requests all day; i wouldn’t want to...” sangwoo stared upward as his alcoholaddled brain struggled to retrieve the elusive word from his already dwindling vocabulary. “burden you with any more work you wouldn’t want to do.”“who said that this was a burden? it’s my job, sir, you don’t need to be coy about getting your needs met.”“mm. and what needs do you think i might have?”the dancer cocked his head, blinking slowly at him, like a content cat. “i can tell if a man wants something he’s too afraid to ask for a mile away. and i think you just want to have a pretty little thing on you, to make you feel like you can be desired, even if it’s for an hour. sir.”“you don’t have to call me sir,” sangwoo replied, shifting in his seat. he swallowed, wishing that he didn’t finish his drink so quickly. he didn’t think he was coordinated enough to go back out into the club to order another one.“sorry. do you likehyungbetter?”sangwoo huffed out a laugh. “that’s not what i meant.”“i don’t know your name, and you don’t want me to call you sir don’t tell me you’re one of those weirdos that want to be calledoppa.”that drew a chuckle from sangwoo. “i don’t think you need to know my name just yet. but if you insist... call me what you’d like. how should i address you, though? what’s your name?”the dancer smirked. “i don’t think you need to know my name just yet.”sangwoo’s mouth twitched upwards at his cheekiness. “i can’t just say ‘hey’ every time i want to get your attention.” he tilted his head, pausing for a bit.“what if i called you ‘angel’?”the dancer raised a brow. “adorable.”“you certainly look like one.” ethereal looks aside, the dancer had on a beautiful sheer white top that had a tied ribbon in the back. sangwoo hazily thought of wedding dresses and how the ones he’d seen sometimes had sheer tulle in the back that almost resembled wings.the ribbon made angel’s waist look even more trim, compared to the breathtaking wide expanse of his shoulders. sangwoo’s fingers twitched from where they rested on the velvet couch, itching to travel across that distance.“you already have me in this room, you don’t need to butter me up further to get to work.” angel grinned at him, taking some steps until he was right in front of sangwoo, weight shifted to one hip as if he had all the time in the world to banter with a sloshed businessman probably twice his age.“i’d never be insincere with you.” sangwoo surprised himself with how earnest he sounded as if he really meant it.angel didn’t respond; he regarded sangwoo with those inquisitive eyes for a few more seconds before leaning over slowly to get right up in sangwoo’s space.fuck, he’s so tall.sangwoo barely managed to suppress a sigh when angel slowly, gently put his knees on both sides of sangwoo’s thighs to cage him in further. he jerked his hands up to avoid touching angel, settling them on the back of the couch instead.“you don’t have to be scared about touching me. as long as there’s no groping, i’m okay with it.”“you’re too beautiful to touch.”angel arched an eyebrow. “i bet you’reamazingwith the ladies.” sangwoo turned away from that statement, but froze when angel gently cupped his jaw to keep him from breaking eye contact.“you’re so warm,” he murmured, lips barely ghosting over sangwoo’s jawline as his fingers barely skimmed his neck, way too close to the pounding pulsepoint that betrayed sangwoo’s frazzled state.sangwoo barely registered angel’s “is this okay?” with a breathless nod, and blew out a shaky breath when he nuzzled the side of his face.he closed his eyes as angel began pressing kisses to this throat, the hollow of his neck where sweat had been beading ever since he entered the room.he let angel unbutton his shirt halfway so the other can trail more kisses down his damp chest; he suppressed the groan that bubbled up from his throat when he felt more than saw angel press his hips deliberately towards his own.his fingers flexed, almost painfully as angel continued his undulations on his lap, as all of his blood rushed south quickly and embarrassingly. surely angel would jump off of him if he felt...thatagainst him.sangwoo was sure that he’d do that and notpressinto that bulge, humming contentedly as his hips did something entirely fluid and sensual that sangwoo could feel from the head of his dick into his belly and all the way to every nerve in his entire body.when angel groaned, sangwoo finally dared to look up to see the man’s head thrown back, those plush lips parted so perfectly as if he was enjoying this.when angel pressed down again sangwoo couldn’t help but arch up into the solid and warm heat, to the pleased surprise of the dancer.“enjoying yourself?” he didn’t even sound out of breath damn youngsters.sangwoo let out a shaky laugh. “very much so.”“touch me.”“what?”angel halted his ministrations, which sangwoo immediately missed, as he took sangwoo’s hands and placed them on his waist.god he’s so perfect“i want you to touch me.”“but”“i don’t care if you feel bad about it, becauseiwant it and i know you do too. so stop kidding yourself and enjoy this with me.” he wiggled himself in sangwoo’s lap, which elicited a low moan from him.sangwoo dazedly looked at the sight in front of him angel staring him down with such intensity that he couldn’t look away even if he wanted to. he tentatively slid his hands up angel’s torso and chest, feeling the firm muscles underneath the light fabric of his top and shakily cupped his face.angel lowered himself until he was hovering right above sangwoo’s lips, and sangwoo could only whisper a timid “can i?” before he was pressed against that heavenly mouth of the beautiful dancer above him.angel kissed him like he had all the time in the world to worship sangwoo’s mouth, tongue coyly brushing at his bottom lip before biting at the swell of it, and kissing it afterward as a belated apology. sangwoo couldn’t help but chase his mouth even as they pulled away to gasp for air. he was so hard that it made him stupidly dizzy, because angel’s ass against his dick was probably the best thing that has happened to him in the past month.“god i wish i could suck you off,” angel mumbled into his mouth.“yeah?” sangwoo breathed out, and his heart stuttered in his chest when he heard angel whimper and press his body into sangwoo’s chest. he was hard.even through layers of clothing, sangwoo could make out the perfect heat that radiated from angel and he pressed a palm to it before he could stop himself.“i’m sorry is this okay?” he mumbled, and angel kissed his sweaty temple in confirmation.“this is great,” angel sighed, as he fit a hand against the seam of sangwoo’s slacks to palm his cock, squeezing and rubbing and surely making a mess out of sangwoo’s briefs as he continued to leak precome.“god, i’m gonna”angel’s free hand was in his hair in an instant, gently tugging his head back to murmur in his ear. “yeah, you gonna come for me? gonna come inside your pants with me just grinding against you?”“ffu” sangwoo squirmed in place trying to get even more friction from the overly warm hands on him, as he clenched his abdomen in response to the building heat and pressure deep in the base of his spine.“yes, baby, come for me, i want daddy to come so i can lick it off of him,” angel gasped, gyrating even harder in sangwoo’s lap as he rutted into his chest.sangwoo shuddered as he heard the pet names fall from angel’s lips, clasped a hand over angel’s so he can jerk off with more pressure on his dick.“aangel, fuck” he thrust more erratically as he could feel his cock spurt one last glob of precome beforea loud knock on the door startled sangwoo into gripping angel’s hips again.“time’s up,” a loud voice declared security manning the private rooms, probably.by the time sangwoo could register that, the extra adrenaline and fear in his system had already softened his cock to a state nowhere near able to come in the short term, and he breathed out a slow, hard breath.“fuck,” angel laughed, head falling forward onto the couch’s back, just centimeters shy of sangwoo’s shoulder. “that was so hot.”“indeed,” sangwoo agreed faintly, head lolling back as he fought to catch his breath. he definitely needed to get back to jogging soon, as tonight was a testament to how much exercise he could take before feeling a bit winded.“i’m sorry you didn’t get to come.”sangwoo waved away his concern with a hand. “it’s... no worries. maybe next time.”“next time?”sangwoo looked up to see an expectant angel looking at him, with... hope seemed like too strong of a word.“next time. are you... free next friday at the same time as well?”“yes. especially for you.”sangwoo huffed out a laugh. “so who’s good with the ladies again?”angel grinned; sangwoo could get used to that crooked, slightly roguish smile.“see me again. i’ll make sure we put an ending to what we started tonight.”sangwoo stood up more steadily than he thought he would, with five drinks already in him on an empty stomach.“there’s a joke in there that i can’t think straight enough to make right now.”"

we don’t even drink winefancilythat often and you come and –“sangwoo cuts him off by turning his body and kissing him, holding gihun close. gihun yelps, but soon holds his face between his hands, deepening the kiss and feeling as close as possible to cho. sangwoo’s arms roam throughout his whole anatomy, stopping on his hips when gihun wrapped both arms around his neck.minutes that felt like hours later, gihun finally breaks the kiss, panting slightly as sangwoo looked at him with one of the biggest smiles he’s ever seen on his face. “you– you are a masochist, coming at me from behind and shagging me senseless. plus, i’m not that young anymore.”cho smiles, pecking his reddened lips before leaning towards the older man’s ear, “it didn’t seem that way last night, hyung.”blushing furiously, seong pushes him off of him, both laughing as they walked towards the table. “i think the food’s already cold.” gihun points out, sitting down in front of sangwoo.“it’ll be tasty as ever, hyung,” cho comforts him, holding his hand briefly. “thank you.”pouring red wine onto their glasses, gihun winks at him with a side smile. “my pleasure, sangwooah.”10 minutes prior midnight, both are lying on the sofa in front of the fireplace, sangwoo’s back pressed to gihun’s chest; enjoying the company from the other. a classic christmas movie is playing on the tv, however gihun knows sangwoo isn’t even paying attention to it, the weight on his torso getting heavier being a solid proof of it.unconsciously, seong glances towards the nearest bookstand, a small, golden packet catching his eye. soon he remembers what exactly that item is.just when sangwoo’s head went limp to his side, gihun swiftly removes the exhausted body of his beloved and races to the stand, grabbing the pack of sparklers on his hands. a shortbeepfrom his smartwatch notifies it’s midnight already.not wanting to waste more time and ruining a rather special moment for the younger man, gihun rushes to sangwoo’s side, carefully shaking his shoulder.“sangwooah,” seong whispers, cho removing on his place childishly, refusing to be woken up. “sangwoo, wake up for a moment, dear.”said nickname, causes sangwoo’s eyes to flutter open, curious about the reason why gihun would choose, from all the affectionate names he’s used in the past,dear.“what?” he says, rubbing his eyes with his sleeve. gihun simply smiles and straightens up, stretching his hand towards him as he hid the other behind his back.“come with me,”sangwoo groans, but accepts his husband’s expecting hand, allowing the older man to lift him up from the heavenly comfort of the couch. gihun grabs one of his fluffiest coats and wraps it around sangwoo’s shoulders, guiding him towards the front porch soon after.frowning at the sudden idea of seong, cho questions, “hyung, what are we doing here? it’s freezing.”gihun smiles, opening the packet of sparklers and grabbing a lighter from his pocket, “we’re going to light some sparklers.”sangwoo’s face instantly illuminates, and gihun can’t help the love he feels towards the younger man getting stronger every passing second. “yyou remembered.”of course i remembered,gihun thinks, bringing sangwoo into a side hug. why wouldn’t he remember sangwoo’s wish ever since they were younger? how could he forget the request he made endlessly throughout their years of friendship of lightning sparklers on christmas?how could he forget sangwoo’s face when he saw the packet of sparklers on gihun’s hand back in the convenience store? hopelessness and sadness on his eyes the moment he realized he couldn’t afford them anymore.and gihun, as the spoiling husband he was – and with the excuse of doing ‘an emergency shopping’ – bought them earlier that day. just for him. just for his sangwoo.looking at sangwoo’s eyes, gihun murmurs, “only for you, sangwoo, not even gayeong gets this kind of spoiling from me.”failing at wiping the wetness under his eyes without being seen, cho tearily smiles, “i love you so much, gihun. i can’t even put it into words how much i –“this time, gihun seals his lips with his own, the younger man feeling warm all over even though they were standing in the middle of one of the coldest nights in december. he surrenders to gihun’s charm, leaning to his side when they separated.with bright smiles on their faces, both men light up every sparkler inside the packet, laughing whenever they felt ticklish because of them, attempting to make figures with them as they agitated their arms.under the covered moonlight, sangwoo can’t help but thank whoever people believed in for putting gihun on his path when they were children. and for bringing him back to his life when he needed him the most. because with seong gihun by his side, cho sangwoo was the luckiest man in the world."
